## Notes

* These 11 papers span **modern DL-heavy**, **OCR-challenging classics**, and **applied real-world datasets**.
* Together they should expose where the liberator pipeline needs tuning (math extraction, OCR quality, image/figure handling).
* Next step: search & download PDFs for these, then run through the liberator to generate `.text.md` + `.manifest.json` outputs for review.
