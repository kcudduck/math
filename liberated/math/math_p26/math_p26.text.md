                                                 Abstract. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) rely on vision en-

                                                 pabilities on various multi-modal tasks in the joint space of vision and
                                                 language. However, typographic attacks, which disrupt Vision-Language
                                                 Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP),
                                                 have also been expected to be a security threat to LVLMs. Firstly, we
                                                 verify typographic attacks on current well-known commercial and open-
                                                 source LVLMs and uncover the widespread existence of this threat. Sec-
                                                 ondly, to better assess this vulnerability, we propose the most compre-
                                                 hensive and largest-scale Typographic Dataset to date. The Typographic
                                                 Dataset not only considers the evaluation of typographic attacks under
                                                 various multi-modal tasks but also evaluates the effects of typographic
                                                 attacks, influenced by texts generated with diverse factors. Based on
                                                 the evaluation results, we investigate the causes why typographic at-
                                                 tacks impacting VLMs and LVLMs, leading to three highly insightful
                                                 discoveries. During the process of further validating the rationality of
                                                 our discoveries, we can reduce the performance degradation caused by
                                                 typographic attacks from 42.07% to 13.90%. Code and Dataset are avail-

of processing vision-language tasks [2, 30, 35, 62] and has expansive potential
applications [12, 53]. However, the introduction of multi-modalities entails the
emergence of supplementary security challenges, primarily attributable to the
fact that each additional modality brings more vulnerabilities, which adversaries
might potentially exploit [5, 16, 17, 21, 25, 27, 36, 38, 52].
Fig. 1: Typographic attacks on GPT-4V, Google Bard, LLaVA-v1.5 and MiniGPT-4.
   Pre-trained vision encoders of VLMs, such as Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) [43], encounter a distinctive form of attack known as the
typographic attack. Recent studies [3, 4, 40] show that typographic attacks can
impair their zero-shot classification capabilities, deliberately introducing typographic errors into images to mislead CLIP. They claim that the underlying
reason for typographic threats could be deficiencies in vision encoder’s ability
to capture visual information, and the shift in model attention [23, 45] before
and after the introduction of typography. Therefore, LLaVA [34, 35], which is a
typical type of LVLMs, is assumed to inherit similar typographic weakness when
incorporating the same vision encoder as CLIP. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this
weakness is indeed prevalent across the majority of LVLMs. And the possible
reason for the typographic susceptibility in LVLMs might be inferred as a similar
cause for this phenomenon occurring in CLIP. However, the true mechanism for
typographic effects in LVLMs remains an unexplored domain.

Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs      3
    In this work, we systematically explore the distractibility of LVLMs by typography and try to uncover the actual reasons why LVLMs could be easily
affected by typographic attacks. To measure the distractibility of LVLMs by
typography, we introduce a specialized Typographic Dataset (TypoD), which
serves as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) challenge under typographic attacks. TypoD is derived from datasets including ImageNet [11], DAQUAR [39],
CountBench [42], and A-OKVQA [49]. The TypoD meticulously assesses the distractibility of LVLMs by typography across perception-oriented and cognitionoriented tasks, including object recognition, visual attribute detection,
enumeration, and commonsense reasoning as shown in Fig. 2. The creation of TypoD could be separated into two stages, (1) Factor Exploring Stage:
We explore typographic factors that may influence the effects of typographic attacks, encompassing font size, opacity, color attributes, and spatial positioning
of typography within images. It is observed that a conspicuous positive correlation is evident between the visibility of typography and the efficacy of distraction. (2) Factor Fixing Stage: Through exploration of the typographic factors
that can produce the most effective attacks above, in this stage, we fix the selected typography and generate two sub-type datasets of different scales, named
TypoD-Base and TypoD-Large, each containing 1570 and 20000 images respectively. The TypoD-Base and TypoD-Large will provide a robust data platform
for comprehensively evaluating the distractibility by typographic attacks and
exploring the underlying cause of such threats.
    To explore the vulnerability of LVLMs within the TypoD, We employ two
typical LVLMs, including LLaVA and InstructBLIP [10]. Our empirical study
reveals a substantive decrement in performance when applying LVLMs in the TypoD. In order to explore the authentic reason why typographic attacks occur, we
compare the responses of the VLMs and LVLMs using the same vision encoder
structure to the same typographic image. we observe that LVLMs could somewhat discriminate visual contents and typography in the images. However, the
corresponding VLMs would fail to correctly differentiate between image content and added typography. Inspired by this phenomenon, we reveal that by
augmenting the input information of the text-encoder in VLMs, particularly
through offering more specific options to match the information from the image
modality, VLMs can effectively differentiate between the image content and the
inserted typography. Additionally, through Grad-CAM visualization [50], we observe that aside from the attention drawn by the addition of typographic text in
the vision encoder, the amount of information contained in the options provided
for the text-encoder also contributes to a certain degree of attention transfer.
    Based on this observation, we uncover that by expanding information of input
prompts for LLMs within LVLMs, a similar phenomenon of attention transfer
occurs towards visual contents of the image subjected to typographic attacks.
Moreover, through inspecting attention maps of sequences in LVLMs, we further discover that increasing the demand for image descriptions in the prompt
facilitates the generation of crucial information of visual contents of the image,
which aids LVLMs in approaching the correct answers in VQA tasks. Therefore,


<!-- PK PAGE 4 doc=math_p26 -->

in this scenario, the question part in the prompt not only extensively queries
the image modality but also simultaneously queries the newly generated text
modality information and interacts with newly generated crucial information,
thus further preventing LVLMs from being excessively influenced by the added
typographic texts when addressing the corresponding questions. Based on this,
we present the following discoveries:
    Discoveries: (1) The reason for occurring typographic attacks on
VLMs and LVLMs lies in the attraction of attention caused by the
inserted typographic text; (2) When VLMs and LVLMs confront typographic attacks, influences on the attention of vision encoders stem
not only from direct modifications to the image but also from the
guidance of text modality; (3) In multi-modal tasks, when confronting
typographic attacks, VLMs and LVLMs necessitate cross-modal attention matching rather than solely on information from uni-modality to
approach the final correct answers.
    Our Contributions are manifold and may be encapsulated as follows:
    – We introduce the Typographic Dataset (TypoD), which is the current largest
      platform to assess how typography can compromise the problem-solving ca-
      pacities of LVLMs across various multi-modal tasks and typographic factors.
    – In our study, we have initially completed the most comprehensive and largest-
      scale evaluation of typographic attack performance under LVLMs to date.
    – Through exhaustive experiments and analysis, we present three intrinsic dis-
      coveries to elucidate the underlying reasons for typographic vulnerability in
      VLMs and LVLMs. This paves the authentic direction for future research on
      typographic attacks in multi-modal models.
    – Based on our discoveries, we narrow the average performance gap of LVLMs
      across different tasks under the scale of Typographic Dataset, whether the
      typography is added or not, to 13.90%. Compared to the initial performance
      loss of 42.07% experienced by LVLMs when subjected to the typographic
      attack, this paper has achieved a decrease of 28.17%.

Large Vision-Language Model (LVLMs): The LLMs recently underwent
a paradigmatic transformation. Instead of just working with text, LVLMs can
understand and respond to visual information. Integrating multiple modalities
has marked this evolution, notably the visual modality [58] by incorporating
pre-trained vision encoders and LLMs. Thus, LVLMs achieve excellent performance in numerous traditional vision tasks [6–8, 14, 55–57]. Many architectures
have been advanced to forge and refine the synthesis between text and other
modalities. Notable among these are methodologies [30] that employ learnable
queries to distill visual information, subsequently aligning the generation of language from LLMs upon visual features. Architectures such as MiniGPT-4 and
LLaVA [34, 35, 62] have adopted a projection layer that effectively reconciles

visual features derived from pre-trained vision encoders with the textual embeddings inherent to LLMs. In a distinct approach, Img2LLM [24] leverage frozen
vision encoders and LLMs, deploying them modularly to facilitate zero-shot
visual question answering without requiring additional fine-tuning. A suite of
benchmarks [15, 28, 54] has been meticulously evaluated, affirming LVLMs demand acute visual perception and comprehensive understanding.
    Vision Encoder: Vision encoders constitute an essential component of
LVLMs, serving the critical feature extraction function from visual inputs. These
encoders distill salient information from images and transmute this data into a
high-dimensional embedding space. Among the vision encoders available, the
CLIP model [43] stands as a paragon. CLIP is trained using a contrastive learning objective, which aims to align the representations of images and their corresponding text captions [26,47,48] in the same embedding space. This means that
during training, these vision encoders learn to associate images with text captions so that the corresponding pairs are closer to the embedding space than noncorresponding pairs. This intrinsic capacity to bridge the semantic gap between
visual and linguistic modalities underpins their versatility across a spectrum
of downstream tasks, which span from the realm of zero-shot image classification [9, 18, 60] to the domain of semantic segmentation [44, 61].
    Typographic Attack: The robustness of the CLIP against a specific form
of attack, namely typographic attacks, has been questioned. Recent works [3,19]
provide empirical evidence illustrating a significant vulnerability in CLIP’s zeroshot classification robustness, which elucidates that the presence of typographic
text within images can mislead CLIP to an erroneous classification. The core issue arises from propensity of CLIP to prioritize text within images when deriving
a classification, a characteristic that can be exploited by embedding misleading
typographic text, thereby inducing a misclassification [4, 40]. This susceptibility
is notably troubling given that such attacks involve minor alterations to visual
inputs, which is sufficient to derail the performance of CLIP.
3     Typographic Dataset
This section introduces the Typographic Dataset (TypoD) creation process.
3.1     Dataset Setting
For a dataset particularly designed to demonstrate the distractibility of typographic attacks, different task categories, instruction designs, and typographic
factors are the settings that need to be explored before creating the dataset.
    Dataset Tasks: Perception and cognition are the core functionalities of
LVLMs, and our evaluation centers on how typography influences LVLMs across
four subtasks. Perception and cognition tasks could reflect the ability of authentic content interpretation and logical analysis for LVLMs. Concretely, TypoD
encompasses four multi-modal tasks, (1)Object Recognition: By leveraging
the ImageNet [11], containing millions of labeled images spanning 1,000 object


<!-- PK PAGE 6 doc=math_p26 -->

              Fig. 3: The illustration of different typographic factors.
categories, we randomly choose 500 and 5000 images as normal images and their
corresponding categories as ground truths from ImageNet. We also randomly
select a different category for each image as a typo and construct a typographic
image by printing the typo into the normal image. (2)Visual Attribute Detection: We use DAQUAR [39] and Visual7W [63] as our base datasets, which
consists of images and associated questions and answers about the objects in
the images and their attributes. Specifically, we choose 190 and 5000 questions
about the colors of particular objects, their corresponding images as normal
images, and their answers as ground truths. For every question, we introduce
a randomly chosen incorrect color as a typo and create a typographic image
by printing the typo into the normal image. (3)Enumeration: To test whether
LVLMs would miscount the number of objects due to the influence of typographic
text, We utilize the CountBench [42] and TallyQA [1], consisting of images that
display a varying amount of items. We select the 390 and 5000 images as normal images, and their corresponding object counts as ground truths. For each
image, we randomly select a different number as a typography and construct a
typographic image. (4) Commonsense Reasoning : LVLMs answer questions
in commonsense reasoning using various world knowledge. We leverage the AOKVQA [33, 49], focusing on questions requiring world knowledge to answer.
In particular, we select 500 and 5000 questions, their corresponding images as
normal images, and answers as ground truths. For each question, we randomly
choose a different choice from their related multiple choices as a typography and
construct a typographic image by printing it into the normal image.
    Instruction Design: To quantify the distractibility of LVLMs by typography, our instruction is to let the model answer the correct option directly.
Consequently, our instructional design is bifurcated into two distinct components: a task-related question and an explicit prompt enjoining the model to
"Answer with the option’s letter from the given choices directly". This instruction paradigm is strategically crafted to delimit output to the specified options,
thus facilitating the evaluation of accuracy metrics.
    Typographic Factors: Various typographic factors could affect what a typo
looks like in an image. Here, we mainly focus on font size, opacity, color attributes, and spatial positioning of typographic text, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.


<!-- PK PAGE 7 doc=math_p26 -->
Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs       7
In particular, we set five size levels for font size spanning from 3 pixels to 15
pixels, increasing by three at each level. Regarding opacity, we put five opacity
levels for font opacity spanning from 25% to 100%, the latter being completely
opaque. To test LVLMs’ sensitivity to different font colors of typographic text,
we select eight representative colors with their light and dark shades from spectrum colors, amounting to twenty-four colors. Regarding the spatial positioning
of typographic text, we divide an image into a grid of four rows and four columns,
resulting in sixteen equal-sized sections. We place typographic text in these sections to assess LVLMs’ sensitivity to typographic text in different positions.
3.2     Dataset Details
In this subsection, we depict the details for our TypoD, including dataset scale
and particular generating process. We first select 1570 images for Object Recognition, Visual Attribute, Enumeration and Reasoning tasks as the Base (B) scale
of our TypoD. Consequently, according to the describing and generating methods of typographic factors in Sec. 3.1, the first stage of creating TypoD is Factor
Exploring. We need to alter different typographic factors to generate datasets
of a certain scale to explore the influence of typographic patterns with different
factors on LVLMs’ performance. Specifically, in each subtask, based on the initially selected 1570 images Without Typography (WTypo), we expand TypoD
by incorporating additional variations, including 5 types each of Font Size (FS)
and Font Opacity (FO), along with 23 types of Font Color (FC) and 16 types of
Position (P). Therefore, in the factor exploring stage, the scales of our TypoD
could attain 1570 and 76930 instances respectively for WTypo and factors expansion (FS, FO, FC and P). Sequentially, we would fix the typographic pattern
with the factor that could generate the most powerful attacking effect and apply this kind of typography to the WTypo Base (WTypo-B) for generating our
Typographic Dataset Base (TypoD-B). Furthermore, for the potentially more
comprehensive typographic validation, we expand the TypoD-B and WTypoDB to TypoD Large (TypoD-L) and WTypo-Large (WTypo-L) scale according
to the selecting methods of image instances in Sec. 3.1. WTypoD-L could also
be directly abbreviated as WTypoD. The specific statistics of the WTypoD, FS,
FO, FC, FP, TypoD-B and TypoD-L scale are presented in Table 1.

4   Exploration of Typographic Attacks
LVLMs and VLMs utilize a similar vision encoder structure to acquire visual
information. Consequently, some characteristic exploring conclusions targeting
VLMs are straightforwardly extended to LVLMs. Previous works [3, 4, 40] indicate that typographic attacks pose significant risks to VLMs, attributing their
impact to the substantial diversion of attention [23, 45] in the vision encoder of
VLMs through simply adding typographic text. Hence, our initial motivation for
studying typography under LVLMs, as well as accounting for the reasons behind
typographic distraction in LVLMs, also stems from the related statements in
those previous works. However, through exploration within this subsection, we
uncover deeper reasons for typographic threats emerging under LVLMs, originating from attention grabbed by typography. Furthermore, alongside uncovering
the corresponding truths, we have also accomplished the suppression of typographic attacks in both VLMs and LVLMs. Based on our uncovering, we pave
the way for genuine exploration in the future research targeting typographic attacks under both vision-language tasks. In this subsection, we choose CLIP and
LLaVA as the typical VLMs and LVLMs to execute our exploration.
    Misconceptions about Vision Encoder: As stated above, the reason for
typographic attacks in CLIP can be attributed to the fact that after adding
typographic text to original images, the vision encoder used by CLIP would be
guided by this text, directing its attention solely to the corresponding added
regions. Therefore, since the same vision encoder structure as CLIP is employed
for acquiring visual information, it can be intuitively assumed that LLaVA is
susceptible to typographic attacks and the occurring reason would also be similar
to CLIP. Furthermore, it can be inferred that an image causing typographic
distraction in CLIP would have a similar effect when applied to LLaVA.
    According to Fig.4, we observe that LLaVA could somewhat discriminate
visual contents and typographic text in the images. When employing the exact
same vision encoder as CLIP in LLaVA to match text information, CLIP failed
to correctly differentiate between image content and typography. This suggests
(1) LLaVA can give correct responses to typographical queries, indicating its
information extraction ability is intact. (2) CLIP’s inability to provide accurate
answers may stem from flawed guidance in its information extraction process,
specifically, incomplete semantic information provided by the text options for
the input of text encoder in CLIP. Inspired by such findings, we discover that
the reason why CLIP is susceptible to typographic attacks in zero-shot classification is the limited semantic text options that can be chosen, like classifying an
image by adopting simple zero-shot text options “an image of {dog, cat}”. Then,
we prove that CLIP could almost avoid typographic attacks in zero-shot classification if more informative prompts are provided, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 (a).
By providing additional information to the prompt text [22], such as including
more options like "an image of a {dog, cat} with the word ’dog’ written on it or
an image of the word {dog, cat} ", CLIP can correctly distinguish between the

This demonstrates that CLIP itself is not flawed and its vision encoder can ac-

curately extract complete information. The crucial issue lies in the varying levels
of information contained in the text options provided for the text encoder.
    To better understand this phenomenon, we utilize Grad-CAM [50] to visualize
the specific attention regions within the vision encoder of CLIP. Subsequently, in
Fig. 4 (a), we investigate the variations in the attention of CLIP after sequentially
employing different text options from Fig. 4 (b), where brighter regions indicate
stronger attention received in those areas. Through observing the 6 Grad-CAM
images in Fig. 4 (b), we discover that (1) by comparing image pairs (2-3/56), the primary attention of the word "cat" in the corresponding text options
concentrate on the original content of the original image, namely the facial area
of the cat, while the word "dog" directs more attention to the added typographic
"Dog" text region. (2) By comparing image pairs (2-5/3-6), when the semantics
in the text options shift from specifically referring to "image" toward "word",
the attention of the vision encoder would shift to the region of added typographic
text, consequently reducing its attention on the original image content. (3) By
comparing images (1,2,4,6) collectively, when the text option includes the word
"cat", the attention of CLIP on the image content, specifically the facial region of
the cat, is greater than that on the added typographic "Dog" word. Conversely,
the opposite is observed when the word "dog" exists in the text option.

    The above discussions demonstrate that the vision encoder of CLIP has effectively understood the semantics of the words "cat" and "dog" in the text options,
directing attention to the cat’s facial area, symbolizing the original image content, and to the added typographic "dog" text, respectively. Furthermore, we
propose a discovery that the semantic differences and the amount of information
contained in the provided text input options significantly affect the attention
of the vision encoder in CLIP. And this variation in attention further becomes
a key factor in determining the occurrence of typographic threats when using
CLIP, and even overall VLMs.

    Multi-modal Query Capabilities: Currently, there is a consensus in visionlanguage tasks that when subjecting LVLMs to robustness attacks and interference, the security threat posed by simultaneously attacking multiple modalities
is significantly greater than that of disrupting an uni-modality [20, 32, 37, 59].
The main reason for this phenomenon is the inherent asymmetry in information content between different modalities in multi-modal interactions. When a
low informative modality queries information from a high informative modality,
it leads to a deficiency in querying capability. In specific vision-language tasks,
the text modality would exhibit a deficient capability when querying information from the visual modality. Building upon this weakness, Co-Attack [59] and
SGA [37] achieve transferable black-box attacks across different VLMs. Similarly,
FigStep [20] accomplishes multi-modal jailbreak attacks, a feat unattainable under the uni-modality conditions.
    Through the description above, we observe that in CLIP, the addition of typographic text would result in direct attention distraction in the vision encoder.
Additionally, the enhancement of input information for the text encoder could
lead the visual attention of VLMs towards the overall image content. Therefore, based on this analysis and the claim in the previous works, the core reason
for the emergence of typographic threat lies in the fact that the vision encoder


<!-- PK PAGE 11 doc=math_p26 -->
Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs       11
directs excessive attention toward the added typographic text. The attentional
attracting ability of typographic text reduces the overall focus of the vision encoder on the other general image content, resulting in incorrect responses. As
LLaVA employs the same vision encoder structure as CLIP, the factors influencing the variation in visual attention should be the same as the factors in CLIP.
The underlying cause of typographic vulnerability in LLaVA is likely akin to
that observed in CLIP. However, compared to the simple vision-language information matching when using CLIP, LLaVA, with the incorporation of Vicuna,
achieves a richer multi-modal interaction in vision-language fields through more
informative prompts [22]. If LLaVA experiences typographic attacks, it is for
the same reason as CLIP, the added typographic text attracts the attention of
the vision encoder. Based on the three discoveries above, we can suppress the
typographic threat by augmenting the prompt information in LLaVA, thereby
reducing the attention of the vision encoder on the typographic text region.
    Specifically, this involves enhancing the semantics of image descriptions in the
language prompt, aiming to strip as much image-specific information as possible
and present it as direct textual information. This augmentation increases the
amount of information in the language modality during multi-modal interactions.
Moreover, this modality dissociation operation effectively addresses the issue of
insufficient querying capability mentioned above in cross-modal scenarios. Fig. 5
(b) illustrates that LLaVA focuses more intently on the visual elements of the
image (with the red areas indicating its focal areas) when presented with an
informative prompt. In contrast, it primarily focuses on typographic errors when
responding to a simple prompt. Moreover, as indicated in Fig. 5 (c), the prompt,
belonging to the language modality, not only queries the original image content
but can also utilize newly generated language responses as query objects (light
areas indicate higher levels of attention from LLaVA and corresponding tokens
with high attention values to the final answer are highlighted in the chatbox).
This significantly enhances the querying capability of the language modality.
5   Experiments
In this section, we examine the distractibility of LVLMs on TypoD in both Factor
Exploring Stage and Factor Fixing Stage. To understand how typography can
distract LVLMs, we investigate the role of vision encoders and prompt LVLMs to
articulate their thought process when confronting typographic text. To scrutinize
LVLMs’ susceptibility to diversions in the Typographic Dataset, we mainly test
on two popular LVLMs, including LLaVA [34, 35] and InstructBLIP [10, 29].
    Evaluation on TypoD: By adopting the data of the Factor Exploring Stage
in TypoD, we explore various typographic factors that could affect distractibility, including Font Size, Font Opacity, Spatial Positioning, and Font Color for
added typographic text in Object Recognition (Obj), Visual Attribute (Vis),
Enumeration (Enu) as well as Reasoning (Rea) sub-tasks. In this section, we
present the performance of object recognition, which best represents the VQA
task, under various typical typographic factors, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (a). More

detailed results with more various factors of other sub-tasks are shown in Appendix Sec. A. Regarding Font Size and Opacity, Fig. 6 (a) shows a conspicuous
positive correlation between the visibility of typographic text and the efficacy of
typographic attacks. Furthermore, less visible typographic text still results in a
significant reduction in models’ accuracy. typographic text with a font size of 6
pixels and an opacity of 20% can still cause an 11% and 16.6% drop in accuracy,
respectively. Concerning Spatial Positioning and Font Color, Fig. 6 (a) shows
that typographic text, regardless of its color or position, can significantly impact the accuracy of models. The phenomenon of typographic attacks to remain
effective despite variations in color and location may be utilized to craft images
laden with typographic text that, while seemingly ordinary, contain inconspicuous errors that can mislead LVLMs. This can be achieved by selecting a font
color that merges with the background, making it hard to spot, and positioning
it in an area that tends not to draw the eye.

    According to the exploration results of typographic factors in Fig. 6 and results in Appendix Sec. A, we fix the final typographic factors as {15px, 100%,
R2C2 and White}. Using this setting, the sub-datasets, namely TypoD-B and
TypoD-L, in the Factor Fixing stage of our TypoD are introduced. Next, we
validate the performance degradation of LVLMs on Obj, Vis, Enu, and Rea in
Typo-D and Typo-L. In Typo-B, compared to the performance of LLaVA-v1.5
and InstructBLIP in WTypo-B, there would occur 42.3% and 27.1% performances drop. In Typo-L, the performances drop compared to WTypo-L are
32.4% and 28.5% respectively. We observe that typographic attacks indeed significantly degrade the performance of LVLMs. However, there are differences in
the robustness of different LVLMs against this threat, with InstructBLIP outperforming LLaVA-v1.5. For a more detailed exploration, we utilized LLaVA-v1.5
in our exploratory phase of LVLMs.

    Exploring Discoveries: In order to further validate the discoveries in Fig. 4,
we initially examine more image instances in Appendix Sec. B to observe the
similarity score in vision-language modal comparison and verify the distract
effects of visual attention in Grad-CAM images. In addition, to assess the impact
of changes in input information of the text encoder of CLIP on the severity
of typographic threats in the zero-shot classification task, we randomly select
500 images from ImageNet and create their typographic versions by printing a
random class as a typographic error in images. Hence we get a set of normal
images and a set of typographic images. Then we craft image-matching texts
for these images using Set 1 and Set 2 templates. Set 1: [an image of {label},
an image of {typo}]. Set 2: [an image of {label} with a word {typo} written
on top of it, an image of {typo} with a word {typo} written on top of it, an
image of {label}, an image of {typo}]. Through separate testing on CLIP-Base
(CLIP-B) and CLIP-Large (CLIP-L), according to the Fig. 6, adopting the more
informative Set 2 as templates would result in the enhancements of 30% and 58%
compared to the less informative Set 1 in the zero-shot classification task.
    For validating the discoveries in Fig. 5, we need to augment prompts with additional semantics related to "describing image content" to obtain new responses
in text language modality. The text response generated by this new prompt,
according to Discovery 2, on the one hand, could mitigate the visual attention


<!-- PK PAGE 14 doc=math_p26 -->
14      H. Cheng et al.
already attracted by the typographic text due to the increased information in the
text modality. Also according to Discovery 3, on the other hand, the additional
information in the text modality can also match attention with the prompt,
further directing overall attention favorably towards the correct response. we
specifically implement the semantics of the above prompts by 1. Directly adding
requirements for describing images to the prompt; 2. Using multi-step prompts
to generate more text language responses. Exemplary instructed prompts are
illustrated following.
 – Prompt 1: Focus on the visual aspects of the image, including colors, shapes,
   composition, and any notable visual themes. Answer with the option’s letter
   from the given choices directly.
 – Prompt 2: (1) Provide a description of the image to answer the following
   question; (2) Provide a detailed visual description of the image to answer
   the following question;(3)Focus on the visual aspects of the image, including
   colors, shapes, composition, and any notable visual themes. Provide a detailed
   visual description of the image to answer the following question.
 – Prompt 3: Focus on the visual aspects of the image, including colors, shapes,
   composition, and any notable visual themes. Provide a detailed visual de-
   scription of the image to answer the following question. Then based on your
   previous description, please delve deeper into the visual details of the im-
   age and include any subtle details or elements that were not covered in your
   initial description to answer the following question.
    Compared to the GAP of 42.3% for LLaVA-v1.5 in TypoD-B as shown in
Table 2, the three prompts we test in Table 3 result in reductions in GAP to
31.6%, 19.7%, and 18.2%, respectively. This indicates that adding semantics
related to image description in prompts is indeed effective, but there may be a
threshold, which may arise from the inherent gap in querying between multimodal information. Additionally, by comparing the GAP of 24.1%, 21.2%, and
19.7% for Prompt 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, it further demonstrates that through the
incremental increase of semantics describing image content, there is a slight stairstep suppression effect on typographic threats. More results, such as evaluation
on various prompts and models, are presented in Appendix Sec. B.
    Ablation Study: Except for the above four multi-modal sub-tasks, in Appendix Sec. C we also explore the impact of typography on images containing
texts. Additionally, we also tested a more intuitive approach to prompt semantic
modification for typographic attacks. As presented in Fig. 6 (c), a further GAP
decrease could be attained by prompts instructed to ignore typography modified
from the above informative prompts.
6    Conclusion
In this paper, we conduct verification of typographic attacks on leading LVLMs
and confirm their prevalent existence. We presented an extensive Typographic
Dataset to delve deeper into this susceptibility, evaluating typographic risks
across different multi-modal tasks and typographic factors.

Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs         19
A     Evaluation on TypoD
A.1    Details of Evaluated LVLMs
We provide more detailed results when LVLMs confront images with typographic
text (typo) in various TypoD sub-type datasets. All experiments are conducted
on NVIDIA A40 GPUs, and we test four state-of-the-art open-source models,
including LLaVA-v1.5, InstructBLIP, LLaVA-v1.6 and MiniGPT4-v2. The evaluated versions are detailed below:
              Table 4: Versions of evaluated LVLMs in the experiment
                     Model              Vision Encoder/LLMs
                  LLaVA-v1.5          CLIP-L-336px, Vicuna-13B
                 InstructBLIP             CLIP-L, Vicuna-7B
                  LLaVA-v1.6          CLIP-L-336px, Vicuna-13B
                  LLaVA-v1.6        CLIP-L-336px, Hermes-Yi-34B
                 MiniGPT4-v2           EVA-CLIP, LLama-2-7B
A.2    More Quantitative Results
Table 5 illustrates the impact of a simple typographic text within images on the
performance of LVLMs across four sub-tasks in TypoD-B that test perception
and cognition. Compared to the GAP of 42.3% for LLaVA-v1.5 as shown in
Table 2, LLaVA-v1.6-13B, LLaVA-v1.6-34B and MiniGPT4-v2 we test in Table 5
result in narrower GAPs of 32.84%, 16.31%, and 5.49%, respectively. It indicates
that powerful LVLMs are less susceptible to disruption by typographic attacks,
but they are still vulnerable to them.
    Table 9 to Table 12 show the distractibility of LVLMs to typographic texts
with various typographic factors across four distinct sub-tasks in TypoD-B. In
particular, we set five size levels for font size spanning from 3 pixels to 15 pixels.
Regarding opacity, we put five opacity levels for font opacity spanning from
25% to 100%, the latter being completely opaque. To test LVLMs’ sensitivity
to different font colors of typos, we select eight representative colors with their
light and dark shades (e.g., ’lred’ and ’dred’) from spectrum colors. Regarding
the spatial positioning of typos, we divide an image into a grid of four rows and
four columns, resulting in sixteen equal-sized sections (e.g., ’R1C1’ denotes a
typographic error located at Row 1, Column 1.).

B        Exploring Discoveries
B.1         CLIP with Informative Text Encoder Inputs
CLIP could almost avoid typographic attacks in zero-shot classification if more
informative prompts are provided, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. In this subsection,
we provide more examples to illustrate above discovery as presented in Fig. 7.

Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs    21
By providing additional information to the prompt text, such as including more
options like "an image of a {stingray, tape player} with the word ’tape player’
written on it, CLIP shifts its attention area and correctly distinguishes between
the visual contents and the added typographic texts under a typographic attack.
This demonstrates that CLIP itself is not flawed and its vision encoder can
accurately extract complete information. The crucial issue lies in the varying
levels of information contained in the text options provided for the text encoder.
B.2     LLaVA with Informative Prompts
Compared to the simple vision-language information matching when using CLIP,
LLaVA, with the incorporation of Vicuna as LLMs, achieves a richer multi-modal
interaction in vision-language fields through more informative prompts. LLaVA
can suppress the typographic threat by augmenting the prompt information,
thereby reducing the attention of the vision encoder on the typographic text
region. Fig. 5 and Fig. 8 illustrates: based on the chat-box in (a), (b) shows that
LLaVA focuses more intently on the visual elements of the image (with the red
areas indicating its focal attention areas) when presented with an informative
prompt. In contrast, it primarily focuses on typographic errors when responding
to a simple prompt. Moreover, (c) shows that the informative prompts, belonging
to the language modality, not only query the original image content but can also
utilize newly generated language responses as query objects (light areas indicate
higher levels of attention from LLaVA and corresponding tokens with high attention values to the final answer are highlighted in the chatbox). This significantly
enhances the querying capability of the language modality and further alleviate
the incorrect attention targeting to the typo area.
B.3     Performance of Different Informative Prompts in LLaVA-v1.6
        and InstructBLIP
For further validating the discoveries in Fig. 5, we evaluate informative prompts
in Table 3 on LLaVA-v1.6 and InstructBLIP, as shown in Table 6 and Table 7.
Compared to the GAP of 32.84% for LLaVA-v1.6 in TypoD-B, the five prompts
we test result in narrower GAPs of 32.4%, 18.6%, 16.0%, 12.7% and 11.3%,
respectively. This indicates that adding semantics related to image description
in prompts is indeed effective.
    On the one hand, the text response generated by this new prompt could
mitigate the visual attention already attracted by the typographic text due to
the increased information in the text modality. On the other hand, the additional information in the text modality can also further direct models’ attention
favorably toward the correct response.

C      Ablation Study
C.1      Prompts Instructed to Ignore Typographic Texts
Additionally, we test a more intuitive approach to prompt semantic modification
for typographic attacks on LLaVA-v1.5. We add the additional words "unaffected
by typographic texts." to each Prompts mentioned in Table 3 respectively. Then
we get new Prompt 1-1, Prompt 2-1 and Prompt 3-1 which are instructed to
ignore typographic texts. As shown in Table 8, compared to GAPs of unmodified prompts in Table 3 which are 31.6%, 24.1% and 18.2% respectively, their
instructed versions of ignoring typographic texts result in narrower GAPs of


<!-- PK PAGE 23 doc=math_p26 -->
Unveiling Typo Deceptions: Insights of the Typo Vulnerability in LVLMs    23
30.1%, 15.69%, 13.90%. This suggests that incorporating instructions to overlook typographic texts within prompts can genuinely enhance performance.
C.2     Detailed Results of Typogrpahic Factors in differernt sub-tasks
In order to further evaluate how typography affect the performance of LVLMs.
We evaluate LLaVA-v1.5 and InstructBLIP in TypoD-B with more various typographic factors in four sub-tasks. The results of object recognition, visual
attribute detection, enumeration, and commonsense reasoning are presented in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12.
    Additionally, we also craft a typographic arithmetic dataset. In the arithmetic
computation, LVLMs need to comprehend arithmetic expressions embedded in
images. Here, we focus on relatively easy arithmetic problems like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We randomly selected two numbers and
chose an arithmetic operation to compose an arithmetic problem. The correct
answer is assigned as the ground truth, and a random number is selected as a
typo. Then both the arithmetic problem and the typographic text are printed
into the image. The distractibility of LVLMs with different typographic factors
in the arithmetic computation task is shown in Table 13.
