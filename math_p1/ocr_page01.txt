EXISTENCE AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE
NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION
CHARLES L. FEFFERMAN

The Euler and Navier—Stokes equations describe the motion of a fluid in R"
(n = 2 or 3). These equations are to be solved for an unknown velocity vector
u(z,t) = (ui(x,t))1<i<n € R™ and pressure p(z,t) € R, defined for position z € R
and time ¢ > 0. We restrict attention here to incompressible fluids filling all of R™.
The Navier-Stokes equations are then given by

(the viscosity), and A = Zﬁ is the Laplacian in the space variables. The FEuler
i=1 i
equations are equations (1), (2), (3) with v set equal to zero.

Equation (1) is just Newton’s law f = ma for a fluid element subject to the ex-
ternal force f = (f;(2,t))1<i<n and to the forces arising from pressure and friction.
Equation (2) just says that the fluid is incompressible. For physically reasonable
solutions, we want to make sure u(x,t) does not grow large as |z| — oco. Hence, we
will restrict attention to forces f and initial conditions u° that satisfy
(4) [02u° (2)] < Carc (14 |z]) =K on R", for any o and K
and
(5) 1029 f(2,t)] < Camr(1+ |2| +1)7F  on R™ x [0,00), for any a,m, K.
We accept a solution of (1), (2), (3) as physically reasonable only if it satisfies

Alternatively, to rule out problems at infinity, we may look for spatially periodic
solutions of (1), (2), (3). Thus, we assume that u°(x), f(x,t) satisfy
