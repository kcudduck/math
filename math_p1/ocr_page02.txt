In place of (4) and (5), we assume that u° is smooth and that
9) 1020 f(2,t)] < Camx (1 +[t)™F  on R® x [0,00), for any o, m, K.

We then accept a solution of (1), (2), (3) as physically reasonable if it satisfies
(10) u(z,t) =u(z +ej,t) onR*x[0,00) for 1<j<n

and

(11) p,u € C®(R" x [0,00)).

A fundamental problem in analysis is to decide whether such smooth, physically
reasonable solutions exist for the Navier-Stokes equations. To give reasonable lee-
way to solvers while retaining the heart of the problem, we ask for a proof of one
of the following four statements.

(A) Existence and smoothness of Navier—Stokes solutions on R?. Take v >
0 and n = 3. Let u°(z) be any smooth, divergence-free vector field satisfying (4).
Take f(z,t) to be identically zero. Then there exist smooth functions p(z, t), u;(x, t)
on R3 x [0, 00) that satisfy (1), (2), (3), (6), (7).

(B) Existence and smoothness of Navier—Stokes solutions in R3/Z3. Take
v >0 and n = 3. Let u°(x) be any smooth, divergence-free vector field satisfying
(8); we take f(z,t) to be identically zero. Then there exist smooth functions p(z, t),
ui(z,t) on R3 x [0, 00) that satisfy (1), (2), (3), (10), (11).

(C) Breakdown of Navier—Stokes solutions on R®. Take v > 0 and n = 3.
Then there exist a smooth, divergence-free vector field u°(z) on R3 and a smooth
f(z,t) on R3 x [0,00), satisfying (4), (5), for which there exist no solutions (p, )
(D) Breakdown of Navier—Stokes Solutions on R®/Z3. Take v > 0 and
n = 3. Then there exist a smooth, divergence-free vector field u°(z) on R® and a
smooth f(z,t) on R? x [0, 00), satisfying (8), (9), for which there exist no solutions
(p,u) of (1), (2), (3), (10), (11) on R3 x [0, 00).

These problems are also open and very important for the Euler equations (v = 0),
although the Euler equation is not on the Clay Institute’s list of prize problems.

Let me sketch the main partial results known regarding the Euler and Navier—
Stokes equations, and conclude with a few remarks on the importance of the ques-
tion.

In two dimensions, the analogues of assertions (A) and (B) have been known
for a long time (Ladyzhenskaya [4]), also for the more difficult case of the Euler
equations. This gives no hint about the three-dimensional case, since the main
difficulties are absent in two dimensions. In three dimensions, it is known that (A)
and (B) hold provided the initial velocity u° satisfies a smallness condition. For
initial data u°(z) not assumed to be small, it is known that (A) and (B) hold (also
for v = 0) if the time interval [0,00) is replaced by a small time interval [0,T),
with 7' depending on the initial data. For a given initial u°(z), the maximum
allowable T is called the “blowup time.” Either (A) and (B) hold, or else there is
a smooth, divergence-free u°(z) for which (1), (2), (3) have a solution with a finite
blowup time. For the Navier-Stokes equations (v > 0), if there is a solution with
