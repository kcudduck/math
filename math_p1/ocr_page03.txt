EXISTENCE AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION 3
a finite blowup time 7', then the velocity (u;(x,t))1<i<3 becomes unbounded near
the blowup time.

Other unpleasant things are known to happen at the blowup time 7', if T' < oco.
For the Euler equations (v = 0), if there is a solution (with f = 0, say) with finite
blowup time T, then the vorticity w(z,t) = curl, u(z,t) satisfies

T
/ { sup \w(z,t)|} dt = 0o (Beale-Kato-Majda),
0 \azer?
so that the vorticity blows up rapidly.

Many numerical computations appear to exhibit blowup for solutions of the
Euler equations, but the extreme numerical instability of the equations makes it
very hard to draw reliable conclusions.

The above results are covered very well in the book of Bertozzi and Majda [1].

Starting with Leray [5], important progress has been made in understanding weak
solutions of the Navier—Stokes equations. To arrive at the idea of a weak solution of
a PDE, one integrates the equation against a test function, and then integrates by
parts (formally) to make the derivatives fall on the test function. For instance, if (1)
and (2) hold, then, for any smooth vector field 0(z,t) = (0;(x,t))1<i<n compactly
supported in R x (0,00), a formal integration by parts yields

Note that (12) makes sense for u € L?, f € L', p € L', whereas (1) makes sense
only if u(z,t) is twice differentiable in z. Similarly, if ¢(x,t) is a smooth function,
compactly supported in R3 x (0,00), then a formal integration by parts and (2)
imply

(13) //u - Vapdrdt = 0.

A solution of (12), (13) is called a weak solution of the Navier—Stokes equations.

A long-established idea in analysis is to prove existence and regularity of solutions
of a PDE by first constructing a weak solution, then showing that any weak solution
is smooth. This program has been tried for Navier-Stokes with partial success.
Leray in [5] showed that the Navier—Stokes equations (1), (2), (3) in three space
dimensions always have a weak solution (p,u) with suitable growth properties.
Uniqueness of weak solutions of the Navier—Stokes equation is not known. For the
Euler equation, uniqueness of weak solutions is strikingly false. Scheffer (8], and,
later, Schnirelman [9] exhibited weak solutions of the Euler equations on R? x R
with compact support in spacetime. This corresponds to a fluid that starts from
rest at time ¢t = 0, begins to move at time ¢t = 1 with no outside stimulus, and
returns to rest at time ¢ = 2, with its motion always confined to a ball B C R®.

Scheffer [7] applied ideas from geometric measure theory to prove a partial
regularity theorem for suitable weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.
