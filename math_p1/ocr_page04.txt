Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg [2] improved Scheffer’s results, and F.-H. Lin [6] sim-
plified the proofs of the results in Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg [2]. The partial regu-
larity theorem of [2], [6] concerns a parabolic analogue of the Hausdorff dimension
of the singular set of a suitable weak solution of Navier—Stokes. Here, the singu-
lar set of a weak solution u consists of all points (z°,2°) € R3 x R such that u
is unbounded in every neighborhood of (2°,t°). (If the force f is smooth, and if
(2°,t°) doesn’t belong to the singular set, then it’s not hard to show that u can be
corrected on a set of measure zero to become smooth in a neighborhood of (x°,¢°).)

To define the parabolic analogue of Hausdorff dimension, we use parabolic cylin-
ders Q, = B, x I, C R® x R, where B, C R? is a ball of radius r, and I,, C R is an
interval of length r2. Given E C R® x R and § > 0, we set

o
Pk,s(E) = inf {Z 'riK: Qry s Qr,, -+ cover E, and each r; < (5}
i=1
and then define
Pk(E) = JLH& Pk, s(E).

The main results of [2], [6] may be stated roughly as follows.

Theorem. (A) Let u be a weak solution of the Navier—Stokes equations, satisfying
suitable growth conditions. Let E be the singular set of u. Then Py(E) = 0.

(B) Given a divergence-free vector field u®(x) and a force f(z,t) satisfying (4)
and (5), there exists a weak solution of Navier-Stokes (1), (2), (3) satisfying the
growth conditions in (A).

In particular, the singular set of u cannot contain a spacetime curve of the form
{(z,t) € R®* x R: 2 = ¢(t)}. This is the best partial regularity theorem known so
far for the Navier—Stokes equation. It appears to be very hard to go further.

Let me end with a few words about the significance of the problems posed here.
Fluids are important and hard to understand. There are many fascinating prob-
lems and conjectures about the behavior of solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. (See, for instance, Bertozzi-Majda [1] or Constantin [3].) Since we don’t
even know whether these solutions exist, our understanding is at a very primitive
level. Standard methods from PDE appear inadequate to settle the problem. In-
stead, we probably need some deep, new ideas.
