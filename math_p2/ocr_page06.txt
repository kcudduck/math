Bibliography
The typical level of difficulty (especially mathematical) of the books is indicated by a number
of asterisks, one meaning mostly introductory and three being advanced. The asterisks are
normalized to these lecture notes, which would be given [**]. The first four books were
frequently consulted in the preparation of these notes, the next seven are other relativity texts
which I have found to be useful, and the last four are mathematical background references.

e B.F. Schutz, A First Course in General Relativity (Cambridge, 1985) [*]. This is a
very nice introductory text. Especially useful if, for example, you aren’t quite clear on
what the energy-momentum tensor really means.

e S. Weinberg, Gravitation and Cosmology (Wiley, 1972) [**¥]. A really good book at
what it does, especially strong on astrophysics, cosmology, and experimental tests.
However, it takes an unusual non-geometric approach to the material, and doesn’t
discuss black holes.

e C. Misner, K. Thorne and J. Wheeler, Gravitation (Freeman, 1973) [**]. A heavy book,
in various senses. Most things you want to know are in here, although you might have
to work hard to get to them (perhaps learning something unexpected in the process).

e R. Wald, General Relativity (Chicago, 1984) [***]. Thorough discussions of a number
of advanced topics, including black holes, global structure, and spinors. The approach
is more mathematically demanding than the previous books, and the basics are covered
pretty quickly.

o E. Taylor and J. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics (Freeman, 1992) [*]. A good introduction
to special relativity.

e R. D’Inverno, Introducing Einstein’s Relativity (Oxford, 1992) [**]. A book I haven’t
looked at very carefully, but it seems as if all the right topics are covered without
noticeable ideological distortion.

e A.P. Lightman, W.H. Press, R.H. Price, and S.A. Teukolsky, Problem Book in Rela-
tivity and Gravitation (Princeton, 1975) [**]. A sizeable collection of problems in all
areas of GR, with fully worked solutions, making it all the more difficult for instructors
to invent problems the students can’t easily find the answers to.

e N. Straumann, General Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics (Springer-Verlag, 1984)
[***¥]. A fairly high-level book, which starts out with a good deal of abstract geometry
and goes on to detailed discussions of stellar structure and other astrophysical topics.
