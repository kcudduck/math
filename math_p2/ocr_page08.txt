1 Special Relativity and Flat Spacetime

We will begin with a whirlwind tour of special relativity (SR) and life in flat spacetime.
The point will be both to recall what SR is all about, and to introduce tensors and related
concepts that will be crucial later on, without the extra complications of curvature on top
of everything else. Therefore, for this section we will always be working in flat spacetime,
and furthermore we will only use orthonormal (Cartesian-like) coordinates. Needless to say
it is possible to do SR in any coordinate system you like, but it turns out that introducing
the necessary tools for doing so would take us halfway to curved spaces anyway, so we will
put that off for a while.

It is often said that special relativity is a theory of 4-dimensional spacetime: three of
space, one of time. But of course, the pre-SR world of Newtonian mechanics featured three
spatial dimensions and a time parameter. Nevertheless, there was not much temptation to
consider these as different aspects of a single 4-dimensional spacetime. Why not?

Consider a garden-variety 2-dimensional plane. It is typically convenient to label the
points on such a plane by introducing coordinates, for example by defining orthogonal = and
y axes and projecting each point onto these axes in the usual way. However, it is clear that
most of the interesting geometrical facts about the plane are independent of our choice of
coordinates. As a simple example, we can consider the distance between two points, given
