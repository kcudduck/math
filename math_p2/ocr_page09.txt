In a different Cartesian coordinate system, defined by 2z’ and 3’ axes which are rotated with
respect to the originals, the formula for the distance is unaltered:
s* = (A2')2 + (Ay)? . (1.2)
We therefore say that the distance is invariant under such changes of coordinates.

This is why it is useful to think of the plane as 2-dimensional: although we use two distinct
numbers to label each point, the numbers are not the essence of the geometry, since we can
rotate axes into each other while leaving distances and so forth unchanged. In Newtonian
physics this is not the case with space and time; there is no useful notion of rotating space
and time into each other. Rather, the notion of “all of space at a single moment in time”
has a meaning independent of coordinates.

Such is not the case in SR. Let us consider coordinates (¢, z, y, z) on spacetime, set up in
the following way. The spatial coordinates (z,y, z) comprise a standard Cartesian system,
constructed for example by welding together rigid rods which meet at right angles. The rods
must be moving freely, unaccelerated. The time coordinate is defined by a set of clocks which
are not moving with respect to the spatial coordinates. (Since this is a thought experiment,
we imagine that the rods are infinitely long and there is one clock at every point in space.)
The clocks are synchronized in the following sense: if you travel from one point in space to
any other in a straight line at constant speed, the time difference between the clocks at the
