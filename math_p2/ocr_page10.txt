1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 3
ends of your journey is the same as if you had made the same trip, at the same speed, in the
other direction. The coordinate system thus constructed is an inertial frame.

An event is defined as a single moment in space and time, characterized uniquely by
(t,7,y,2). Then, without any motivation for the moment, let us introduce the spacetime
interval between two events:

§7 = —(cAt)? + (Az)? + (Ay)* + (Az)%. (1.3)
(Notice that it can be positive, negative, or zero even for two nonidentical points.) Here, ¢
is some fixed conversion factor between space and time; that is, a fixed velocity. Of course
it will turn out to be the speed of light; the important thing, however, is not that photons
happen to travel at that speed, but that there exists a ¢ such that the spacetime interval
is invariant under changes of coordinates. In other words, if we set up a new inertial frame
(t',2',y', 2') by repeating our earlier procedure, but allowing for an offset in initial position,
angle, and velocity between the new rods and the old, the interval is unchanged:
s* = —(cAY)? + (Ax)? 4 (Ay)? + (AZ)? . (1.4)
This is why it makes sense to think of SR as a theory of 4-dimensional spacetime, known
as Minkowski space. (This is a special case of a 4-dimensional manifold, which we will
deal with in detail later.) As we shall see, the coordinate transformations which we have
implicitly defined do, in a sense, rotate space and time into each other. There is no absolute
notion of “simultaneous events”; whether two things occur at the same time depends on the
coordinates used. Therefore the division of Minkowski space into space and time is a choice
we make for our own purposes, not something intrinsic to the situation.

Almost all of the “paradoxes” associated with SR result from a stubborn persistence of
the Newtonian notions of a unique time coordinate and the existence of “space at a single
moment in time.” By thinking in terms of spacetime rather than space and time together,
these paradoxes tend to disappear.

Let’s introduce some convenient notation. Coordinates on spacetime will be denoted by
letters with Greek superscript indices running from 0 to 3, with 0 generally denoting the
time coordinate. Thus,

P jz - ; (L.5)

(Don’t start thinking of the superscripts as exponents.) Furthermore, for the sake of sim-
plicity we will choose units in which
