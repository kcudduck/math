3 CURVATURE 93
curvature, which is always antisymmetric in its last two indices, is a (1,1)-tensor-valued
two-form, R%,,,. Using our freedom to suppress indices on differential forms, we can write
the defining relations for these two tensors as
T% = de® + wh A e (3.137)
and
R = dw? + W AwS, . (3138)
These are known as the Maurer-Cartan structure equations. They are equivalent to
the usual definitions; let’s go through the exercise of showing this for the torsion, and you
can check the curvature for yourself. We have
A A
T = e T."
= ei(@uey“ —0e, + wu"'be,,b — w,,"be#b)
A A
= I, -, (3.139)
which is just the original definition we gave. Here we have used (3.131), the expression for
the Fﬁy’s in terms of the vielbeins and spin connection. We can also express identities obeyed
by these tensors as
dT® + W% AT = R% A€ (3.140)
and
dR% +w'  AR% — R Aw% =0 . (3.141)
The first of these is the generalization of R?[;,,; = 0, while the second is the Bianchi identity
Vr Ry = 0. (Sometimes both equations are called Bianchi identities.)

The form of these expressions leads to an almost irresistible temptation to define a
“covariant-exterior derivative”, which acts on a tensor-valued form by taking the ordinary
exterior derivative and then adding appropriate terms with the spin connection, one for each
Latin index. Although we won’t do that here, it is okay to give in to this temptation, and
in fact the right hand side of (3.137) and the left hand sides of (3.140) and (3.141) can be
thought of as just such covariant-exterior derivatives. But be careful, since (3.138) cannot;
you can’t take any sort of covariant derivative of the spin connection, since it’s not a tensor.

So far our equations have been true for general connections; let’s see what we get for the
Christoffel connection. The torsion-free requirement is just that (3.137) vanish; this does
not lead immediately to any simple statement about the coefficients of the spin connection.
Metric compatibility is expressed as the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the metric:
Vg = 0. We can see what this leads to when we express the metric in the orthonormal basis,
where its components are simply 74:
