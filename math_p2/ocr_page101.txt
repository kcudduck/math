= —Wuab — Wyba - (3142)
Then setting this equal to zero implies
Wpab = —Wyba - (3.143)
Thus, metric compatibility is equivalent to the antisymmetry of the spin connection in its
Latin indices. (As before, such a statement is only sensible if both indices are either upstairs
or downstairs.) These two conditions together allow us to express the spin connection in
terms of the vielbeins. There is an explicit formula which expresses this solution, but in
practice it is easier to simply solve the torsion-free condition
WP Aep = —de (3.144)
using the asymmetry of the spin connection, to find the individual components.

We now have the means to compare the formalism of connections and curvature in Rie-
mannian geometry to that of gauge theories in particle physics. (This is an aside, which is
hopefully comprehensible to everybody, but not an essential ingredient of the course.) In
both situations, the fields of interest live in vector spaces which are assigned to each point
in spacetime. In Riemannian geometry the vector spaces include the tangent space, the
cotangent space, and the higher tensor spaces constructed from these. In gauge theories,
on the other hand, we are concerned with “internal” vector spaces. The distinction is that
the tangent space and its relatives are intimately associated with the manifold itself, and
were naturally defined once the manifold was set up; an internal vector space can be of any
dimension we like, and has to be defined as an independent addition to the manifold. In
math lingo, the union of the base manifold with the internal vector spaces (defined at each
point) is a fiber bundle, and each copy of the vector space is called the “fiber” (in perfect
accord with our definition of the tangent bundle).

Besides the base manifold (for us, spacetime) and the fibers, the other important ingre-
dient in the definition of a fiber bundle is the “structure group,” a Lie group which acts
on the fibers to describe how they are sewn together on overlapping coordinate patches.
Without going into details, the structure group for the tangent bundle in a four-dimensional
spacetime is generally GL(4,R), the group of real invertible 4 x 4 matrices; if we have a
Lorentzian metric, this may be reduced to the Lorentz group SO(3,1). Now imagine that
we introduce an internal three-dimensional vector space, and sew the fibers together with
ordinary rotations; the structure group of this new bundle is then SO(3). A field that lives
in this bundle might be denoted ¢*(2*), where A runs from one to three; it is a three-vector
(an internal one, unrelated to spacetime) for each point on the manifold. We have freedom
to choose the basis in the fibers in any way we wish; this means that “physical quantities”
should be left invariant under local SO(3) transformations such as

oA (a") — ¢ (a") = O 4 ()™ (2") | (3.145)
