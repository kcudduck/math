where O4 4(2#) is a matrix in SO(3) which depends on spacetime. Such transformations
are known as gauge transformations, and theories invariant under them are called “gauge
theories.”

For the most part it is not hard to arrange things such that physical quantities are
invariant under gauge transformations. The one difficulty arises when we consider partial
derivatives, 8#(/5‘4. Because the matrix O4'4(z*) depends on spacetime, it will contribute an
unwanted term to the transformation of the partial derivative. By now you should be able
to guess the solution: introduce a connection to correct for the inhomogeneous term in the
transformation law. We therefore define a connection on the fiber bundle to be an object
AHA B, With two “group indices” and one spacetime index. Under GCT'’s it transforms as a
one-form, while under gauge transformations it transforms as

AN g =0 105" A48 — 090,07 . (3.146)
(Beware: our conventions are so drastically different from those in the particle physics liter-
ature that I won’t even try to get them straight.) With this transformation law, the “gauge
covariant derivative”

D, = 0,0 + A, po® (3.147)
transforms “tensorially” under gauge transformations, as you are welcome to check. (In
ordinary electromagnetism the connection is just the conventional vector potential. No
indices are necessary, because the structure group U(1) is one-dimensional.)

It is clear that this notion of a connection on an internal fiber bundle is very closely
related to the connection on the tangent bundle, especially in the orthonormal-frame picture
we have been discussing. The transformation law (3.146), for example, is exactly the same
as the transformation law (3.134) for the spin connection. We can also define a curvature or
“field strength” tensor which is a two-form,

FAp=dAp + A% N A% | (3.148)
in exact correspondence with (3.138). We can parallel transport things along paths, and
there is a construction analogous to the parallel propagator; the trace of the matrix obtained
by parallel transporting a vector around a closed curve is called a “Wilson loop.”

We could go on in the development of the relationship between the tangent bundle and
internal vector bundles, but time is short and we have other fish to fry. Let us instead finish
by emphasizing the important difference between the two constructions. The difference
stems from the fact that the tangent bundle is closely related to the base manifold, while
other fiber bundles are tacked on after the fact. It makes sense to say that a vector in the
tangent space at p “points along a path” through p; but this makes no sense for an internal
vector bundle. There is therefore no analogue of the coordinate basis for an internal space —
