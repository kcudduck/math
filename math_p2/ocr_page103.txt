3 CURVATURE 96
partial derivatives along curves have nothing to do with internal vectors. It follows in turn
that there is nothing like the vielbeins, which relate orthonormal bases to coordinate bases.
The torsion tensor, in particular, is only defined for a connection on the tangent bundle, not
for any gauge theory connections; it can be thought of as the covariant exterior derivative
of the vielbein, and no such construction is available on an internal bundle. You should
appreciate the relationship between the different uses of the notion of a connection, without
getting carried away.
