4 Gravitation

Having paid our mathematical dues, we are now prepared to examine the physics of gravita-
tion as described by general relativity. This subject falls naturally into two pieces: how the
curvature of spacetime acts on matter to manifest itself as “gravity”, and how energy and
momentum influence spacetime to create curvature. In either case it would be legitimate
to start at the top, by stating outright the laws governing physics in curved spacetime and
working out their consequences. Instead, we will try to be a little more motivational, starting
with basic physical principles and attempting to argue that these lead naturally to an almost
unique physical theory.

The most basic of these physical principles is the Principle of Equivalence, which comes
in a variety of forms. The earliest form dates from Galileo and Newton, and is known as
the Weak Equivalence Principle, or WEP. The WEP states that the “inertial mass” and
“gravitational mass” of any object are equal. To see what this means, think about Newton’s
Second Law. This relates the force exerted on an object to the acceleration it undergoes,
setting them proportional to each other with the constant of proportionality being the inertial
mass m;:

f=ma. (4.1)
The inertial mass clearly has a universal character, related to the resistance you feel when
you try to push on the object; it is the same constant no matter what kind of force is being
exerted. We also have the law of gravitation, which states that the gravitational force exerted
on an object is proportional to the gradient of a scalar field ®, known as the gravitational
potential. The constant of proportionality in this case is called the gravitational mass my:
fy=-m,Vo . (4.2)
On the face of it, m, has a very different character than m;; it is a quantity specific to the
gravitational force. If you like, it is the “gravitational charge” of the body. Nevertheless,
Galileo long ago showed (apocryphally by dropping weights off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
actually by rolling balls down inclined planes) that the response of matter to gravitation was
universal — every object falls at the same rate in a gravitational field, independent of the
composition of the object. In Newtonian mechanics this translates into the WEP, which is
simply
m; =my (4.3)
for any object. An immediate consequence is that the behavior of freely-falling test particles
is universal, independent of their mass (or any other qualities they may have); in fact we
