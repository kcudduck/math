The universality of gravitation, as implied by the WEP, can be stated in another, more
popular, form. Imagine that we consider a physicist in a tightly sealed box, unable to
observe the outside world, who is doing experiments involving the motion of test particles,
for example to measure the local gravitational field. Of course she would obtain different
answers if the box were sitting on the moon or on Jupiter than she would on the Earth.
But the answers would also be different if the box were accelerating at a constant velocity;
this would change the acceleration of the freely-falling particles with respect to the box.
The WEP implies that there is no way to disentangle the effects of a gravitational field
from those of being in a uniformly accelerating frame, simply by observing the behavior of
freely-falling particles. This follows from the universality of gravitation; it would be possible
to distinguish between uniform acceleration and an electromagnetic field, by observing the
behavior of particles with different charges. But with gravity it is impossible, since the
“charge” is necessarily proportional to the (inertial) mass.

To be careful, we should limit our claims about the impossibility of distinguishing gravity
from uniform acceleration by restricting our attention to “small enough regions of spacetime.”
If the sealed box were sufficiently big, the gravitational field would change from place to place
in an observable way, while the effect of acceleration is always in the same direction. In a
rocket ship or elevator, the particles always fall straight down:

In a very big box in a gravitational field, however, the particles will move toward the center
of the Earth (for example), which might be a different direction in different regions:
