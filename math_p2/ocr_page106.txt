The WEP can therefore be stated as “the laws of freely-falling particles are the same in a

gravitational field and a uniformly accelerated frame, in small enough regions of spacetime.”

In larger regions of spacetime there will be inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, which

will lead to tidal forces which can be detected.

After the advent of special relativity, the concept of mass lost some of its uniqueness, as
it became clear that mass was simply a manifestation of energy and momentum (E = mc?
and all that). It was therefore natural for Einstein to think about generalizing the WEP
to something more inclusive. His idea was simply that there should be no way whatsoever
for the physicist in the box to distinguish between uniform acceleration and an external
gravitational field, no matter what experiments she did (not only by dropping test particles).
This reasonable extrapolation became what is now known as the Einstein Equivalence
Principle, or EEP: “In small enough regions of spacetime, the laws of physics reduce to
those of special relativity; it is impossible to detect the existence of a gravitational field.”

In fact, it is hard to imagine theories which respect the WEP but violate the EEP.
Consider a hydrogen atom, a bound state of a proton and an electron. Its mass is actually
less than the sum of the masses of the proton and electron considered individually, because
there is a negative binding energy — you have to put energy into the atom to separate the
proton and electron. According to the WEP, the gravitational mass of the hydrogen atom is
therefore less than the sum of the masses of its constituents; the gravitational field couples
to electromagnetism (which holds the atom together) in exactly the right way to make the
gravitational mass come out right. This means that not only must gravity couple to rest
mass universally, but to all forms of energy and momentum — which is practically the claim
of the EEP. It is possible to come up with counterexamples, however; for example, we could
imagine a theory of gravity in which freely falling particles began to rotate as they moved
through a gravitational field. Then they could fall along the same paths as they would in
an accelerated frame (thereby satisfying the WEP), but you could nevertheless detect the
