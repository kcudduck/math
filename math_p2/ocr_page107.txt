4 GRAVITATION 100
existence of the gravitational field (in violation of the EEP). Such theories seem contrived,
but there is no law of nature which forbids them.

Sometimes a distinction is drawn between “gravitational laws of physics” and “non-
gravitational laws of physics,” and the EEP is defined to apply only to the latter. Then
one defines the “Strong Equivalence Principle” (SEP) to include all of the laws of physics,
gravitational and otherwise. I don’t find this a particularly useful distinction, and won’t
belabor it. For our purposes, the EEP (or simply “the principle of equivalence”) includes all
of the laws of physics.

It is the EEP which implies (or at least suggests) that we should attribute the action
of gravity to the curvature of spacetime. Remember that in special relativity a prominent
role is played by inertial frames — while it was not possible to single out some frame of
reference as uniquely “at rest”, it was possible to single out a family of frames which were
“unaccelerated” (inertial). The acceleration of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field
was therefore uniquely defined with respect to these frames. The EEP, on the other hand,
implies that gravity is inescapable — there is no such thing as a “gravitationally neutral
object” with respect to which we can measure the acceleration due to gravity. It follows
that “the acceleration due to gravity” is not something which can be reliably defined, and
therefore is of little use.

Instead, it makes more sense to define “unaccelerated” as “freely falling,” and that is
what we shall do. This point of view is the origin of the idea that gravity is not a “force”
— a force is something which leads to acceleration, and our definition of zero acceleration is
“moving freely in the presence of whatever gravitational field happens to be around.”

This seemingly innocuous step has profound implications for the nature of spacetime. In
SR, we had a procedure for starting at some point and constructing an inertial frame which
stretched throughout spacetime, by joining together rigid rods and attaching clocks to them.
But, again due to inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, this is no longer possible. If
we start in some freely-falling state and build a large structure out of rigid rods, at some
distance away freely-falling objects will look like they are “accelerating” with respect to this
reference frame, as shown in the figure on the next page.
