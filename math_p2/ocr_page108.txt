4 GRAVITATION 101

The solution is to retain the notion of inertial frames, but to discard the hope that they
can be uniquely extended throughout space and time. Instead we can define locally inertial
frames, those which follow the motion of freely falling particles in small enough regions of
spacetime. (Every time we say “small enough regions”, purists should imagine a limiting
procedure in which we take the appropriate spacetime volume to zero.) This is the best we
can do, but it forces us to give up a good deal. For example, we can no longer speak with
confidence about the relative velocity of far away objects, since the inertial reference frames
appropriate to those objects are independent of those appropriate to us.

So far we have been talking strictly about physics, without jumping to the conclusion
that spacetime should be described as a curved manifold. It should be clear, however, why
such a conclusion is appropriate. The idea that the laws of special relativity should be
obeyed in sufficiently small regions of spacetime, and further that local inertial frames can
be established in such regions, corresponds to our ability to construct Riemann normal coor-
dinates at any one point on a manifold — coordinates in which the metric takes its canonical
form and the Christoffel symbols vanish. The impossibility of comparing velocities (vectors)
at widely separated regions corresponds to the path-dependence of parallel transport on a
curved manifold. These considerations were enough to give Einstein the idea that gravity
was a manifestation of spacetime curvature. But in fact we can be even more persuasive.
(It is impossible to “prove” that gravity should be thought of as spacetime curvature, since
scientific hypotheses can only be falsified, never verified [and not even really falsified, as
Thomas Kuhn has famously argued]. But there is nothing to be dissatisfied with about
convincing plausibility arguments, if they lead to empirically successful theories.)

Let’s consider one of the celebrated predictions of the EEP, the gravitational redshift.
Consider two boxes, a distance z apart, moving (far away from any matter, so we assume
in the absence of any gravitational field) with some constant acceleration a. At time ¢ the
trailing box emits a photon of wavelength .
