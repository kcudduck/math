The boxes remain a constant distance apart, so the photon reaches the leading box after
a time At = z/c in the reference frame of the boxes. In this time the boxes will have picked
up an additional velocity Av = aAt = az/c. Therefore, the photon reaching the lead box
will be redshifted by the conventional Doppler effect by an amount

(We assume Awv/c is small, so we only work to first order.) According to the EEP, the
same thing should happen in a uniform gravitational field. So we imagine a tower of height
z sitting on the surface of a planet, with a, the strength of the gravitational field (what
Newton would have called the “acceleration due to gravity”).

This situation is supposed to be indistinguishable from the previous one, from the point of
view of an observer in a box at the top of the tower (able to detect the emitted photon, but
