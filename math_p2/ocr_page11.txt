1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 4
we will therefore leave out factors of ¢ in all subsequent formulae. Empirically we know that
c is the speed of light, 3 x 10® meters per second; thus, we are working in units where 1 second
equals 3 x 10® meters. Sometimes it will be useful to refer to the space and time components
of z# separately, so we will use Latin superscripts to stand for the space components alone:
ol =g
¥ t=y (1.7)
3=z

It is also convenient to write the spacetime interval in a more compact form. We therefore
introduce a 4 x 4 matrix, the metric, which we write using two lower indices:

-1 0 0 0

0 1 00

0 0 01
(Some references, especially field theory books, define the metric with the opposite sign, so
be careful.) We then have the nice formula

s% = At Az (1.9)

Notice that we use the summation convention, in which indices which appear both as
superscripts and subscripts are summed over. The content of (1.9) is therefore just the same
as (1.3).

Now we can consider coordinate transformations in spacetime at a somewhat more ab-
stract level than before. What kind of transformations leave the interval (1.9) invariant?
One simple variety are the translations, which merely shift the coordinates:

ot — gt =2t et (1.10)
where a* is a set of four fixed numbers. (Notice that we put the prime on the index, not on
the x.) Translations leave the differences Ax#* unchanged, so it is not remarkable that the
interval is unchanged. The only other kind of linear transformation is to multiply z* by a
(spacetime-independent) matrix:

= A (1.11)

or, in more conventional matrix notation,
¥ = Az . (1.12)
These transformations do not leave the differences Az* unchanged, but multiply them also
by the matrix A. What kind of matrices will leave the interval invariant? Sticking with the

matrix notation, what we would like is
' = (Ax)'y(Az) = (A2)Tn(Ax')

= (Az2)TAThA(AT) (1.13)
