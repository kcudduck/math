otherwise unable to look outside the box). Therefore, a photon emitted from the ground
with wavelength )¢ should be redshifted by an amount

This is the famous gravitational redshift. Notice that it is a direct consequence of the EEP,
not of the details of general relativity. It has been verified experimentally, first by Pound
and Rebka in 1960. They used the Mossbauer effect to measure the change in frequency in
~-rays as they traveled from the ground to the top of Jefferson Labs at Harvard.

The formula for the redshift is more often stated in terms of the Newtonian potential
®, where a, = V®. (The sign is changed with respect to the usual convention, since we
are thinking of a, as the acceleration of the reference frame, not of a particle with respect
to this reference frame.) A non-constant gradient of ® is like a time-varying acceleration,
and the equivalent net velocity is given by integrating over the time between emission and
absorption of the photon. We then have

where A is the total change in the gravitational potential, and we have once again set
¢ = 1. This simple formula for the gravitational redshift continues to be true in more general
circumstances. Of course, by using the Newtonian potential at all, we are restricting our
domain of validity to weak gravitational fields, but that is usually completely justified for
observable effects.

The gravitational redshift leads to another argument that we should consider spacetime
as curved. Consider the same experimental setup that we had before, now portrayed on the
spacetime diagram on the next page.

The physicist on the ground emits a beam of light with wavelength Ay from a height z,
which travels to the top of the tower at height z;. The time between when the beginning of
any single wavelength of the light is emitted and the end of that same wavelength is emitted
is Aty = Ao/c, and the same time interval for the absorption is At; = A /c. Since we imagine
that the gravitational field is not varying with time, the paths through spacetime followed
by the leading and trailing edge of the single wave must be precisely congruent. (They are
represented by some generic curved paths, since we do not pretend that we know just what
the paths will be.) Simple geometry tells us that the times Atg and A¢; must be the same.
But of course they are not; the gravitational redshift implies that Aty > Atg. (Which we
can interpret as “the clock on the tower appears to run more quickly.”) The fault lies with
