“simple geometry”; a better description of what happens is to imagine that spacetime is
curved.

All of this should constitute more than enough motivation for our claim that, in the
presence of gravity, spacetime should be thought of as a curved manifold. Let us now take
this to be true and begin to set up how physics works in a curved spacetime. The principle of
equivalence tells us that the laws of physics, in small enough regions of spacetime, look like
those of special relativity. We interpret this in the language of manifolds as the statement
that these laws, when written in Riemannian normal coordinates z# based at some point
p, are described by equations which take the same form as they would in flat space. The
simplest example is that of freely-falling (unaccelerated) particles. In flat space such particles
move in straight lines; in equations, this is expressed as the vanishing of the second derivative
of the parameterized path z#(\):

d*a
D 0. (4.8)
According to the EEP, exactly this equation should hold in curved space, as long as the
coordinates z* are RNC’s. What about some other coordinate system? As it stands, (4.8)
is not an equation between tensors. However, there is a unique tensorial equation which
reduces to (4.8) when the Christoffel symbols vanish; it is

Of course, this is simply the geodesic equation. In general relativity, therefore, free particles
move along geodesics; we have mentioned this before, but now you know why it is true.

As far as free particles go, we have argued that curvature of spacetime is necessary to
describe gravity; we have not yet shown that it is sufficient. To do so, we can show how the
usual results of Newtonian gravity fit into the picture. We define the “Newtonian limit” by
three requirements: the particles are moving slowly (with respect to the speed of light), the
