4 GRAVITATION 105
gravitational field is weak (can be considered a perturbation of flat space), and the field is
also static (unchanging with time). Let us see what these assumptions do to the geodesic
equation, taking the proper time 7 as an affine parameter. “Moving slowly” means that

so the geodesic equation becomes

Since the field is static, the relevant Christoffel symbols I'fy, simplify:

Finally, the weakness of the gravitational field allows us to decompose the metric into the
Minkowski form plus a small perturbation:
v = Mv + Py || << 1. (4.13)
(We are working in Cartesian coordinates, so 7, is the canonical form of the metric. The
“smallness condition” on the metric perturbation h,, doesn’t really make sense in other
coordinates.) From the definition of the inverse metric, "’ g,, = 0%, we find that to first
order in h,
gt =" — (4.14)
where b = n*1"?h,,. In fact, we can use the Minkowski metric to raise and lower indices
on an object of any definite order in h, since the corrections would only contribute at higher
orders.
Putting it all together, we find

The geodesic equation (4.11) is therefore
