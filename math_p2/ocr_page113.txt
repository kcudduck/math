That is, j{ is constant. To examine the spacelike components of (4.16), recall that the
spacelike components of n* are just those of a 3 x 3 identity matrix. We therefore have

Dividing both sides by (%) has the effect of converting the derivative on the left-hand side
from 7 to t, leaving us with

This begins to look a great deal like Newton’s theory of gravitation. In fact, if we compare
this equation to (4.4), we find that they are the same once we identify
hop = =20 , (4.20)
or in other words
goo = —(1 +2) . (4.21)
Therefore, we have shown that the curvature of spacetime is indeed sufficient to describe
gravity in the Newtonian limit, as long as the metric takes the form (4.21). It remains, of
course, to find field equations for the metric which imply that this is the form taken, and
that for a single gravitating body we recover the Newtonian formula

but that will come soon enough.

Our next task is to show how the remaining laws of physics, beyond those governing freely-
falling particles, adapt to the curvature of spacetime. The procedure essentially follows the
paradigm established in arguing that free particles move along geodesics. Take a law of
physics in flat space, traditionally written in terms of partial derivatives and the flat metric.
According to the equivalence principle this law will hold in the presence of gravity, as long
as we are in Riemannian normal coordinates. Translate the law into a relationship between
tensors; for example, change partial derivatives to covariant ones. In RNC’s this version of
the law will reduce to the flat-space one, but tensors are coordinate-independent objects, so
the tensorial version must hold in any coordinate system.

This procedure is sometimes given a name, the Principle of Covariance. I'm not
sure that it deserves its own name, since it’s really a consequence of the EEP plus the
requirement that the laws of physics be independent of coordinates. (The requirement that
laws of physics be independent of coordinates is essentially impossible to even imagine being
untrue. Given some experiment, if one person uses one coordinate system to predict a result
and another one uses a different coordinate system, they had better agree.) Another name
