is the “comma-goes-to-semicolon rule”, since at a typographical level the thing you have to
do is replace partial derivatives (commas) with covariant ones (semicolons).

We have already implicitly used the principle of covariance (or whatever you want to
call it) in deriving the statement that free particles move along geodesics. For the most
part, it is very simple to apply it to interesting cases. Consider for example the formula for
conservation of energy in flat spacetime, 9,7 = 0. The adaptation to curved spacetime is
immediate:

V. T" =0. (4.23)
This equation expresses the conservation of energy in the presence of a gravitational field.

Unfortunately, life is not always so easy. Consider Maxwell’s equations in special relativ-
ity, where it would seem that the principle of covariance can be applied in a straightforward
way. The inhomogeneous equation 9, F* = 4w.J” becomes

V' =An]” (4.24)
and the homogeneous one 9, F,5 = 0 becomes
Vi =0. (4.25)
On the other hand, we could also write Maxwell’s equations in flat space in terms of differ-
ential forms as
d(xF) = 4dn(xJ) , (4.26)
and
dF =0. (4.27)
These are already in perfectly tensorial form, since we have shown that the exterior derivative
is a well-defined tensor operator regardless of what the connection is. We therefore begin
to worry a little bit; what is the guarantee that the process of writing a law of physics in
tensorial form gives a unique answer? In fact, as we have mentioned earlier, the differential
forms versions of Maxwell’s equations should be taken as fundamental. Nevertheless, in this
case it happens to make no difference, since in the absence of torsion (4.26) is identical
to (4.24), and (4.27) is identical to (4.25); the symmetric part of the connection doesn’t
contribute. Similarly, the definition of the field strength tensor in terms of the potential A,
can be written either as
or equally well as
F=dA. (4.29)

The worry about uniqueness is a real one, however. Imagine that two vector fields X*

and Y obey a law in flat space given by
Y*0,0,X" =0 . (4.30)
