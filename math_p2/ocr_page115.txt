4 GRAVITATION 108
The problem in writing this as a tensor equation should be clear: the partial derivatives can
be commuted, but covariant derivatives cannot. If we simply replace the partials in (4.30)
by covariant derivatives, we get a different answer than we would if we had first exchanged
the order of the derivatives (leaving the equation in flat space invariant) and then replaced
them. The difference is given by

yrv,v, X" -Y"v, v, X" =-R,Y"X". (4.31)
The prescription for generalizing laws from flat to curved spacetimes does not guide us in
choosing the order of the derivatives, and therefore is ambiguous about whether a term
such as that in (4.31) should appear in the presence of gravity. (The problem of ordering
covariant derivatives is similar to the problem of operator-ordering ambiguities in quantum
mechanics.)

In the literature you can find various prescriptions for dealing with ambiguities such as
this, most of which are sensible pieces of advice such as remembering to preserve gauge
invariance for electromagnetism. But deep down the real answer is that there is no way to
resolve these problems by pure thought alone; the fact is that there may be more than one
way to adapt a law of physics to curved space, and ultimately only experiment can decide
between the alternatives.

In fact, let us be honest about the principle of equivalence: it serves as a useful guideline,
but it does not deserve to be treated as a fundamental principle of nature. From the modern
point of view, we do not expect the EEP to be rigorously true. Consider the following
alternative version of (4.24):

V(14 aR)F™| = 4w J" (4.32)
where R is the Ricci scalar and « is some coupling constant. If this equation correctly
described electrodynamics in curved spacetime, it would be possible to measure R even in
an arbitrarily small region, by doing experiments with charged particles. The equivalence
principle therefore demands that o = 0. But otherwise this is a perfectly respectable equa-
tion, consistent with charge conservation and other desirable features of electromagnetism,
which reduces to the usual equation in flat space. Indeed, in a world governed by quantum
mechanics we expect all possible couplings between different fields (such as gravity and elec-
tromagnetism) that are consistent with the symmetries of the theory (in this case, gauge
invariance). So why is it reasonable to set & = 07 The real reason is one of scales. Notice that
the Ricci tensor involves second derivatives of the metric, which is dimensionless, so R has
dimensions of (length)~2 (with ¢ = 1). Therefore o must have dimensions of (length)?. But
since the coupling represented by « is of gravitational origin, the only reasonable expectation
for the relevant length scale is
