where [p is the Planck length
1/2
lp= (%) =1.6x107% cm , (4.34)

where h is of course Planck’s constant. So the length scale corresponding to this coupling is
extremely small, and for any conceivable experiment we expect the typical scale of variation
for the gravitational field to be much larger. Therefore the reason why this equivalence-
principle-violating term can be safely ignored is simply because aR is probably a fantastically
small number, far out of the reach of any experiment. On the other hand, we might as well
keep an open mind, since our expectations are not always borne out by observation.

Having established how physical laws govern the behavior of fields and objects in a curved
spacetime, we can complete the establishment of general relativity proper by introducing
Einstein’s field equations, which govern how the metric responds to energy and momentum.
We will actually do this in two ways: first by an informal argument close to what Einstein
himself was thinking, and then by starting with an action and deriving the corresponding
equations of motion.

The informal argument begins with the realization that we would like to find an equation
which supersedes the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential:

V2® = dnGp , (4.35)
where V2 = §“9,0; is the Laplacian in space and p is the mass density. (The explicit form of
® given in (4.22) is one solution of (4.35), for the case of a pointlike mass distribution.) What
characteristics should our sought-after equation possess? On the left-hand side of (4.35) we
have a second-order differential operator acting on the gravitational potential, and on the
right-hand side a measure of the mass distribution. A relativistic generalization should take
the form of an equation between tensors. We know what the tensor generalization of the mass
density is; it’s the energy-momentum tensor 7),,. The gravitational potential, meanwhile,
should get replaced by the metric tensor. We might therefore guess that our new equation
will have 7}, set proportional to some tensor which is second-order in derivatives of the
metric. In fact, using (4.21) for the metric in the Newtonian limit and Tyy = p, we see that
in this limit we are looking for an equation that predicts
but of course we want it to be completely tensorial.

The left-hand side of (4.36) does not obviously generalize to a tensor. The first choice
might be to act the D’Alembertian O = V#V, on the metric g,,, but this is automatically
zero by metric compatibility. Fortunately, there is an obvious quantity which is not zero
