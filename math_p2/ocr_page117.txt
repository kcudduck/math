and is constructed from second derivatives (and first derivatives) of the metric: the Riemann
tensor R’5,,. It doesn’t have the right number of indices, but we can contract it to form the
Ricci tensor R, which does (and is symmetric to boot). It is therefore reasonable to guess
that the gravitational field equations are
Ry = KT, , (4.37)
for some constant . In fact, Einstein did suggest this equation at one point. There is a prob-
lem, unfortunately, with conservation of energy. According to the Principle of Equivalence,
the statement of energy-momentum conservation in curved spacetime should be
VT, =0, (4.38)
which would then imply
V¥R, =0 . (4.39)
This is certainly not true in an arbitrary geometry; we have seen from the Bianchi identity
(3.94) that
1
V'R, = ivuR . (4.40)
But our proposed field equation implies that R = kg"'T},, = kT, so taking these together
we have
V.T=0. (4.41)
The covariant derivative of a scalar is just the partial derivative, so (4.41) is telling us that T
is constant throughout spacetime. This is highly implausible, since T = 0 in vacuum while
T > 0 in matter. We have to try harder.

(Actually we are cheating slightly, in taking the equation V*T),, = 0 so seriously. If as
we said, the equivalence principle is only an approximate guide, we could imagine that there
are nonzero terms on the right-hand side involving the curvature tensor. Later we will be
more precise and argue that they are strictly zero.)

Of course we don’t have to try much harder, since we already know of a symmetric (0, 2)
tensor, constructed from the Ricci tensor, which is automatically conserved: the Einstein
tensor 1

G = Ry — iRguu ) (4.42)

which always obeys V#G,,, = 0. We are therefore led to propose
G = kT, (4.43)
as a field equation for the metric. This equation satisfies all of the obvious requirements;
the right-hand side is a covariant expression of the energy and momentum density in the
