form of a symmetric and conserved (0, 2) tensor, while the left-hand side is a symmetric and
conserved (0,2) tensor constructed from the metric and its first and second derivatives. It
only remains to see whether it actually reproduces gravity as we know it.
To answer this, note that contracting both sides of (4.43) yields (in four dimensions)
R=—xT, (4.44)
and using this we can rewrite (4.43) as
1
R = k(T — 5Tgu,,) . (4.45)
This is the same equation, just written slightly differently. We would like to see if it predicts
Newtonian gravity in the weak-field, time-independent, slowly-moving-particles limit. In
this limit the rest energy p = Ty will be much larger than the other terms in 7}, so we
want to focus on the u = 0, ¥ = 0 component of (4.45). In the weak-field limit, we write (in
accordance with (4.13) and (4.14))
goo = —1+hoo,
g° = —1—hey . (4.46)
The trace of the energy-momentum tensor, to lowest nontrivial order, is
T = ¢"To = —Too - (4.47)
Plugging this into (4.45), we get
1
This is an equation relating derivatives of the metric to the energy density. To find the
explicit expression in terms of the metric, we need to evaluate Ry = Roxo. In fact we only
need Ry, since R%o = 0. We have
Rigjo = 9;Thy — Aol + Ti\Ioy — Thaly - (4.49)
The second term here is a time derivative, which vanishes for static fields. The third and
fourth terms are of the form (I')2, and since I is first-order in the metric perturbation these
contribute only at second order, and can be neglected. We are left with Rgjo = 9,I'%. From
this we get
Roo = Rimol
= 0 (§9M(309A0 + dogox — 8)\900))
