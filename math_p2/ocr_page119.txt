Lo

Comparing to (4.48), we see that the 00 component of (4.43) in the Newtonian limit predicts
V2hoo = —kTpo - (4.51)
But this is exactly (4.36), if we set k = 87G.

So our guess seems to have worked out. With the normalization fixed by comparison
with the Newtonian limit, we can present Einstein’s equations for general relativity:

R, — %Ry;m =81GT,, . (4.52)
These tell us how the curvature of spacetime reacts to the presence of energy-momentum.
Einstein, you may have heard, thought that the left-hand side was nice and geometrical,
while the right-hand side was somewhat less compelling.

Einstein’s equations may be thought of as second-order differential equations for the
metric tensor field g,,. There are ten independent equations (since both sides are symmetric
two-index tensors), which seems to be exactly right for the ten unknown functions of the
metric components. However, the Bianchi identity V#G,,, = 0 represents four constraints on
the functions Ry, so there are only six truly independent equations in (4.52). In fact this is
appropriate, since if a metric is a solution to Einstein’s equation in one coordinate system
#* it should also be a solution in any other coordinate system z#'. This means that there are
four unphysical degrees of freedom in g,, (represented by the four functions =* (2*)), and
we should expect that Einstein’s equations only constrain the six coordinate-independent
degrees of freedom.

As differential equations, these are extremely complicated; the Ricci scalar and tensor are
contractions of the Riemann tensor, which involves derivatives and products of the Christoffel
symbols, which in turn involve the inverse metric and derivatives of the metric. Furthermore,
the energy-momentum tensor 7, will generally involve the metric as well. The equations
are also nonlinear, so that two known solutions cannot be superposed to find a third. It
is therefore very difficult to solve Einstein’s equations in any sort of generality, and it is
usually necessary to make some simplifying assumptions. Even in vacuum, where we set the
energy-momentum tensor to zero, the resulting equations (from (4.45))

R, =0 (4.53)
can be very difficult to solve. The most popular sort of simplifying assumption is that the
metric has a significant degree of symmetry, and we will talk later on about how symmetries
of the metric make life easier.

The nonlinearity of general relativity is worth remarking on. In Newtonian gravity the
potential due to two point masses is simply the sum of the potentials for each mass, but
