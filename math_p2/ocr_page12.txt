and therefore
n=ATnA (1.14)

or

Npoe = N Gy A o0y (1.15)
We want to find the matrices A¥, such that the components of the matrix Ny are the
same as those of 1,,; that is what it means for the interval to be invariant under these
transformations.

The matrices which satisfy (1.14) are known as the Lorentz transformations; the set
of them forms a group under matrix multiplication, known as the Lorentz group. There is
a close analogy between this group and O(3), the rotation group in three-dimensional space.
The rotation group can be thought of as 3 x 3 matrices R which satisfy

1=R"1R, (1.16)
where 1 is the 3 x 3 identity matrix. The similarity with (1.14) should be clear; the only
difference is the minus sign in the first term of the metric 7, signifying the timelike direction.
The Lorentz group is therefore often referred to as O(3,1). (The 3 x 3 identity matrix is
simply the metric for ordinary flat space. Such a metric, in which all of the eigenvalues are
positive, is called Euclidean, while those such as (1.8) which feature a single minus sign are
called Lorentzian.)

Lorentz transformations fall into a number of categories. First there are the conventional
rotations, such as a rotation in the z-y plane:

1 0 0 0
' 0 cosf sinf 0
W
A 0 —sinf cosf 0| ° (1.17)
0 0 0 1
The rotation angle # is a periodic variable with period 2w. There are also boosts, which
may be thought of as “rotations between space and time directions.” An example is given
by
coshg —sinh¢g 0 0
' —sinh¢ cosh¢ 0 0
A, = . 1.1
v 0 0 10 (1.18)

0 0 0 1
The boost parameter ¢, unlike the rotation angle, is defined from —oo to co. There are
also discrete transformations which reverse the time direction or one or more of the spa-
tial directions. (When these are excluded we have the proper Lorentz group, SO(3,1).) A
general transformation can be obtained by multiplying the individual transformations; the
