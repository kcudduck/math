clearly this does not carry over to general relativity (outside the weak-field limit). There is
a physical reason for this, namely that in GR the gravitational field couples to itself. This
can be thought of as a consequence of the equivalence principle — if gravitation did not
couple to itself, a “gravitational atom” (two particles bound by their mutual gravitational
attraction) would have a different inertial mass (due to the negative binding energy) than
gravitational mass. From a particle physics point of view this can be expressed in terms of
Feynman diagrams. The electromagnetic interaction between two electrons can be thought
of as due to exchange of a virtual photon:

o-

photon

o
But there is no diagram in which two photons exchange another photon between themselves;
electromagnetism is linear. The gravitational interaction, meanwhile, can be thought of
as due to exchange of a virtual graviton (a quantized perturbation of the metric). The
nonlinearity manifests itself as the fact that both electrons and gravitons (and anything
else) can exchange virtual gravitons, and therefore exert a gravitational force:

o
graviton gravitons
o

There is nothing profound about this feature of gravity; it is shared by most gauge theories,
such as quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interactions. (Electromagnetism
is actually the exception; the linearity can be traced to the fact that the relevant gauge group,
U(1), is abelian.) But it does represent a departure from the Newtonian theory. (Of course
this quantum mechanical language of Feynman diagrams is somewhat inappropriate for GR,
which has not [yet] been successfully quantized, but the diagrams are just a convenient
shorthand for remembering what interactions exist in the theory.)
