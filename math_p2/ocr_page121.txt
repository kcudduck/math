To increase your confidence that Einstein’s equations as we have derived them are indeed
the correct field equations for the metric, let’s see how they can be derived from a more
modern viewpoint, starting from an action principle. (In fact the equations were first derived
by Hilbert, not Einstein, and Hilbert did it using the action principle. But he had been
inspired by Einstein’s previous papers on the subject, and Einstein himself derived the
equations independently, so they are rightly named after Einstein. The action, however, is
rightly called the Hilbert action.) The action should be the integral over spacetime of a
Lagrange density (“Lagrangian” for short, although strictly speaking the Lagrangian is the
integral over space of the Lagrange density):
S = / d"vLy . (4.54)
The Lagrange density is a tensor density, which can be written as \/—g times a scalar. What
scalars can we make out of the metric? Since we know that the metric can be set equal to
its canonical form and its first derivatives set to zero at any one point, any nontrivial scalar
must involve at least second derivatives of the metric. The Riemann tensor is of course
made from second derivatives of the metric, and we argued earlier that the only independent
scalar we could construct from the Riemann tensor was the Ricci scalar R. What we did not
show, but is nevertheless true, is that any nontrivial tensor made from the metric and its
first and second derivatives can be expressed in terms of the metric and the Riemann tensor.
Therefore, the only independent scalar constructed from the metric, which is no higher than
second order in its derivatives, is the Ricci scalar. Hilbert figured that this was therefore the
simplest possible choice for a Lagrangian, and proposed
Ly=+v—gR. (4.55)
The equations of motion should come from varying the action with respect to the metric.
In fact let us consider variations with respect to the inverse metric g"”, which are slightly
easier but give an equivalent set of equations. Using R = g"” R, in general we will have
6 = [ @ [V=g9"Ru + V=gRudg" + R3v/=g]
= (69)1 +(6S)2+ (6S)s . (4.56)
The second term (0.5)s is already in the form of some expression times dg*”; let’s examine
the others more closely.
Recall that the Ricci tensor is the contraction of the Riemann tensor, which is given by
Ry =030, + T4, T, — (A=) . (4.57)
The variation of this with respect the metric can be found first varying the connection with
respect to the metric, and then substituting into this expression. Let us however consider
