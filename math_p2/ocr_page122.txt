arbitrary variations of the connection, by replacing
ry, =TIy, +drv, . (4.58)
The variation 6I'), is the difference of two connections, and therefore is itself a tensor. We
can thus take its covariant derivative,
VA(OI%,) = 0\(01,) + 5, 6Ly, — T5,01% , — I5,6I%, . (4.59)
Given this expression (and a small amount of labor) it is easy to show that
SR = VA(OIY,) = V,(0T%,) - (4.60)
You can check this yourself. Therefore, the contribution of the first term in (4.56) to 6.5 can
be written
(65), = / d"zy/=g g" [VA(8T3,) — ¥, (6T},
= [@aev=g 9, [g7T,) - 9 (T3] | (4.61)
where we have used metric compatibility and relabeled some dummy indices. But now we
have the integral with respect to the natural volume element of the covariant divergence of
a vector; by Stokes’s theorem, this is equal to a boundary contribution at infinity which we
can set to zero by making the variation vanish at infinity. (We haven’t actually shown that
Stokes’s theorem, as mentioned earlier in terms of differential forms, can be thought of this
way, but you can easily convince yourself it’s true.) Therefore this term contributes nothing
to the total variation.
To make sense of the (45); term we need to use the following fact, true for any matrix
M:
Tr(In M) = In(det M) . (4.62)
Here, In M is defined by exp(ln M) = M. (For numbers this is obvious, for matrices it’s a
little less straightforward.) The variation of this identity yields
1
Te(M~'6M) = ———5(det M) . 4.63
( ) = qorppd(det M) (4.63)
Here we have used the cyclic property of the trace to allow us to ignore the fact that M~*
and 0 M may not commute. Now we would like to apply this to the inverse metric, M = g”.
Then det M = g~ (where g = det g,,), and
