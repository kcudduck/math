Now we can just plug in:
V=g = 5[(1*9’1)’1/2]
= —5(=g7) (=g

Hearkening back to (4.56), and remembering that (65); does not contribute, we find
1
59 = / ey=g [RW - éRg,“,] g . (4.66)
This should vanish for arbitrary variations, so we are led to Einstein’s equations in vacuum:
1 68 1
=gog" Ry — ing =0. (4.67)
The fact that this simple action leads to the same vacuum field equations as we had
previously arrived at by more informal arguments certainly reassures us that we are doing
something right. What we would really like, however, is to get the non-vacuum field equations
as well. That means we consider an action of the form
1
S=—7=Su+S5u, 4.68
srG Y M (4.68)
where S); is the action for matter, and we have presciently normalized the gravitational
action (although the proper normalization is somewhat convention-dependent). Following
through the same procedure as above leads to
1 oS 1 1 1 Sy
= (le - —Rg;,,,) + Y =0 ) <469)
V—gdog 881G 2 =g dg™
and we recover Einstein’s equations if we can set
T = =TT (4.70)
What makes us think that we can make such an identification? In fact (4.70) turns out to
be the best way to define a symmetric energy-momentum tensor. The tricky part is to show
that it is conserved, which is in fact automatically true, but which we will not justify until
the next section.
We say that (4.70) provides the “best” definition of the energy-momentum tensor because
it is not the only one you will find. In flat Minkowski space, there is an alternative defini-
tion which is sometimes given in books on electromagnetism or field theory. In this context
