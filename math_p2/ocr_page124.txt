energy-momentum conservation arises as a consequence of symmetry of the Lagrangian un-
der spacetime translations. Noether’s theorem states that every symmetry of a Lagrangian
implies the existence of a conservation law; invariance under the four spacetime translations
leads to a tensor S* which obeys 9,5* = 0 (four relations, one for each value of v). The
details can be found in Wald or in any number of field theory books. Applying Noether’s
procedure to a Lagrangian which depends on some fields ¢* and their first derivatives 9,1,
we obtain
SH = oL Y — L (4.71)

where a sum over 7 is implied. You can check that this tensor is conserved by virtue of the
equations of motion of the matter fields. S*” often goes by the name “canonical energy-
momentum tensor”; however, there are a number of reasons why it is more convenient for
us to use (4.70). First and foremost, (4.70) is in fact what appears on the right hand side of
Einstein’s equations when they are derived from an action, and it is not always possible to
generalize (4.71) to curved spacetime. But even in flat space (4.70) has its advantages; it is
manifestly symmetric, and also guaranteed to be gauge invariant, neither of which is true for
(4.71). We will therefore stick with (4.70) as the definition of the energy-momentum tensor.
Sometimes it is useful to think about Einstein’s equations without specifying the theory
of matter from which 7}, is derived. This leaves us with a great deal of arbitrariness; consider
for example the question “What metrics obey Einstein’s equations?” In the absence of some
constraints on 7T}, the answer is “any metric at all”; simply take the metric of your choice,
compute the Einstein tensor G, for this metric, and then demand that 7}, be equal to G,,, .
(It will automatically be conserved, by the Bianchi identity.) Our real concern is with the
existence of solutions to Einstein’s equations in the presence of “realistic” sources of energy
and momentum, whatever that means. The most common property that is demanded of
T,. is that it represent positive energy densities — no negative masses are allowed. In a
locally inertial frame this requirement can be stated as p = Tyo > 0. To turn this into a
coordinate-independent statement, we ask that
T, V*VY >0, for all timelike vectors V* . (4.72)
This is known as the Weak Energy Condition, or WEC. It seems like a fairly reasonable
requirement, and many of the important theorems about solutions to general relativity (such
as the singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose) rely on this condition or something
very close to it. Unfortunately it is not set in stone; indeed, it is straightforward to invent
otherwise respectable classical field theories which violate the WEC, and almost impossible
to invent a quantum field theory which obeys it. Nevertheless, it is legitimate to assume
that the WEC holds in all but the most extreme conditions. (There are also stronger energy
conditions, but they are even less true than the WEC, and we won’t dwell on them.)
