4 GRAVITATION 118

We have now justified Einstein’s equations in two different ways: as the natural covariant
generalization of Poisson’s equation for the Newtonian gravitational potential, and as the
result of varying the simplest possible action we could invent for the metric. The rest of
the course will be an exploration of the consequences of these equations, but before we start
on that road let us briefly explore ways in which the equations could be modified. There
are an uncountable number of such ways, but we will consider four different possibilities:
the introduction of a cosmological constant, higher-order terms in the action, gravitational
scalar fields, and a nonvanishing torsion tensor.

The first possibility is the cosmological constant; George Gamow has quoted Einstein as
calling this the biggest mistake of his life. Recall that in our search for the simplest possible
action for gravity we noted that any nontrivial scalar had to be of at least second order in
derivatives of the metric; at lower order all we can create is a constant. Although a constant
does not by itself lead to very interesting dynamics, it has an important effect if we add it
to the conventional Hilbert action. We therefore consider an action given by

S = / d"z/=g(R - 2A) , (4.73)
where A is some constant. The resulting field equations are

and of course there would be an energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side if we had
included an action for matter. A is the cosmological constant; it was originally introduced
by Einstein after it became clear that there were no solutions to his equations representing
a static cosmology (a universe unchanging with time on large scales) with a nonzero matter
content. If the cosmological constant is tuned just right, it is possible to find a static solution,
but it is unstable to small perturbations. Furthermore, once Hubble demonstrated that the
universe is expanding, it became less important to find static solutions, and Einstein rejected
his suggestion. Like Rasputin, however, the cosmological constant has proven difficult to kill
off. If we like we can move the additional term in (4.74) to the right hand side, and think of
it as a kind of energy-momentum tensor, with 7, = —Ag,, (it is automatically conserved
by metric compatibility). Then A can be interpreted as the “energy density of the vacuum,”
a source of energy and momentum that is present even in the absence of matter fields. This
interpretation is important because quantum field theory predicts that the vacuum should
have some sort of energy and momentum. In ordinary quantum mechanics, an harmonic
oscillator with frequency w and minimum classical energy Ey = 0 upon quantization has a
ground state with energy Fy = %hw. A quantized field can be thought of as a collection of
an infinite number of harmonic oscillators, and each mode contributes to the ground state
energy. The result is of course infinite, and must be appropriately regularized, for example
