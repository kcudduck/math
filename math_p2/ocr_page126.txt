by introducing a cutoff at high frequencies. The final vacuum energy, which is the regularized
sum of the energies of the ground state oscillations of all the fields of the theory, has no good
reason to be zero and in fact would be expected to have a natural scale

A~ m‘}) , (4.75)
where the Planck mass mp is approximately 10! GeV, or 107 grams. Observations of the
universe on large scales allow us to constrain the actual value of A, which turns out to be
smaller than (4.75) by at least a factor of 10'2°. This is the largest known discrepancy between
theoretical estimate and observational constraint in physics, and convinces many people that
the “cosmological constant problem” is one of the most important unsolved problems today.
On the other hand the observations do not tell us that A is strictly zero, and in fact allow
values that can have important consequences for the evolution of the universe. This mistake
of Einstein’s therefore continues to bedevil both physicists, who would like to understand
why it is so small, and astronomers, who would like to determine whether it is really small
enough to be ignored.

A somewhat less intriguing generalization of the Hilbert action would be to include scalars
of more than second order in derivatives of the metric. We could imagine an action of the
form

S = /d"x\/Tg(R + R+ R R + 03"V, RV, R+ ) , (4.76)
where the a’s are coupling constants and the dots represent every other scalar we can make
from the curvature tensor, its contractions, and its derivatives. Traditionally, such terms
have been neglected on the reasonable grounds that they merely complicate a theory which
is already both aesthetically pleasing and empirically successful. However, there are at
least three more substantive reasons for this neglect. First, as we shall see below, Einstein’s
equations lead to a well-posed initial value problem for the metric, in which “coordinates” and
“momenta” specified at an initial time can be used to predict future evolution. With higher-
derivative terms, we would require not only those data, but also some number of derivatives
of the momenta. Second, the main source of dissatisfaction with general relativity on the part
of particle physicists is that it cannot be renormalized (as far as we know), and Lagrangians
with higher derivatives tend generally to make theories less renormalizable rather than more.
Third, by the same arguments we used above when speaking about the limitations of the
principle of equivalence, the extra terms in (4.76) should be suppressed (by powers of the
Planck mass to some power) relative to the usual Hilbert term, and therefore would not be
expected to be of any practical importance to the low-energy world. None of these reasons
are completely persuasive, and indeed people continue to consider such theories, but for the
most part these models do not attract a great deal of attention.

A set of models which does attract attention are known as scalar-tensor theories of
gravity, since they involve both the metric tensor g,, and a fundamental scalar field, A. The
