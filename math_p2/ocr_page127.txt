where f(A) and V(\) are functions which define the theory. Recall from (4.68) that the
coefficient of the Ricci scalar in conventional GR is proportional to the inverse of Newton’s
constant G. In scalar-tensor theories, then, where this coefficient is replaced by some function
of a field which can vary throughout spacetime, the “strength” of gravity (as measured by
the local value of Newton’s constant) will be different from place to place and time to time.
In fact the most famous scalar-tensor theory, invented by Brans and Dicke and now named
after them, was inspired by a suggestion of Dirac’s that the gravitational constant varies
with time. Dirac had noticed that there were some interesting numerical coincidences one
could discover by taking combinations of cosmological numbers such as the Hubble constant
Hy (a measure of the expansion rate of the universe) and typical particle-physics parameters
such as the mass of the pion, m,. For example,

m3 G
Ho ~oT (4.78)

If we assume for the moment that this relation is not simply an accident, we are faced with
the problem that the Hubble “constant” actually changes with time (in most cosmological
models), while the other quantities conventionally do not. Dirac therefore proposed that in
fact G varied with time, in such a way as to maintain (4.78); satisfying this proposal was
the motivation of Brans and Dicke. These days, experimental test of general relativity are
sufficiently precise that we can state with confidence that, if Brans-Dicke theory is correct,
the predicted change in G over space and time must be very small, much slower than that
necessary to satisfy Dirac’s hypothesis. (See Weinberg for details on Brans-Dicke theory
and experimental tests.) Nevertheless there is still a great deal of work being done on other
kinds of scalar-tensor theories, which turn out to be vital in superstring theory and may
have important consequences in the very early universe.

As a final alternative to general relativity, we should mention the possibility that the
connection really is not derived from the metric, but in fact has an independent existence as a
fundamental field. We will leave it as an exercise for you to show that it is possible to consider
the conventional action for general relativity but treat it as a function of both the metric
g and a torsion-free connection F;I,., and the equations of motion derived from varying
such an action with respect to the connection imply that F;(, is actually the Christoffel
connection associated with g,,. We could drop the demand that the connection be torsion-
free, in which case the torsion tensor could lead to additional propagating degrees of freedom.
Without going into details, the basic reason why such theories do not receive much attention
is simply because the torsion is itself a tensor; there is nothing to distinguish it from other,
