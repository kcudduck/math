“non-gravitational” tensor fields. Thus, we do not really lose any generality by considering
theories of torsion-free connections (which lead to GR) plus any number of tensor fields,
which we can name what we like.

With the possibility in mind that one of these alternatives (or, more likely, something
we have not yet thought of) is actually realized in nature, for the rest of the course we will
work under the assumption that general relativity as based on Einstein’s equations or the
Hilbert action is the correct theory, and work out its consequences. These consequences, of
course, are constituted by the solutions to Einstein’s equations for various sources of energy
and momentum, and the behavior of test particles in these solutions. Before considering
specific solutions in detail, lets look more abstractly at the initial-value problem in general
relativity.

In classical Newtonian mechanics, the behavior of a single particle is of course governed
by f = ma. If the particle is moving under the influence of some potential energy field ®(z),
then the force is f = —V®, and the particle obeys

This is a second-order differential equation for z*(¢), which we can recast as a system of two
coupled first-order equations by introducing the momentum p:

The initial-value problem is simply the procedure of specifying a “state” (x, p') which serves
as a boundary condition with which (4.80) can be uniquely solved. You may think of (4.80)
as allowing you, once you are given the coordinates and momenta at some time ¢, to evolve
them forward an infinitesimal amount to a time ¢ + ¢, and iterate this procedure to obtain
the entire solution.

We would like to formulate the analogous problem in general relativity. Einstein’s equa-
tions G, = 87GT),, are of course covariant; they don’t single out a preferred notion of “time”
through which a state can evolve. Nevertheless, we can by hand pick a spacelike hypersurface
(or “slice”) ¥, specify initial data on that hypersurface, and see if we can evolve uniquely
from it to a hypersurface in the future. (“Hyper” because a constant-time slice in four di-
mensions will be three-dimensional, whereas “surfaces” are conventionally two-dimensional.)
This process does violence to the manifest covariance of the theory, but if we are careful we
should wind up with a formulation that is equivalent to solving Einstein’s equations all at
once throughout spacetime.

Since the metric is the fundamental variable, our first guess is that we should consider
the values g,, |5 of the metric on our hypersurface to be the “coordinates” and the time
