derivatives 0;g,w|s (With respect to some specified time coordinate) to be the “momenta”,
which together specify the state. (There will also be coordinates and momenta for the matter
fields, which we will not consider explicitly.) In fact the equations G, = 87GT),, do involve
second derivatives of the metric with respect to time (since the connection involves first
derivatives of the metric and the Einstein tensor involves first derivatives of the connection),
so we seem to be on the right track. However, the Bianchi identity tells us that V,G* = 0.
We can rewrite this equation as

BGY = —9,G" — FﬁAG)“’ - I“Z)\G“A . (4.81)
A close look at the right hand side reveals that there are no third-order time derivatives;
therefore there cannot be any on the left hand side. Thus, although G* as a whole involves
second-order time derivatives of the metric, the specific components G do not. Of the ten
independent components in Einstein’s equations, the four represented by

G = 8rGT™ (4.82)
cannot be used to evolve the initial data (g, 99 ). Rather, they serve as constraints
on this initial data; we are not free to specify any combination of the metric and its time
derivatives on the hypersurface ¥, since they must obey the relations (4.82). The remaining
equations,

GY = 8rGTY (4.83)
are the dynamical evolution equations for the metric. Of course, these are only six equations
for the ten unknown functions g,,(x7), so the solution will inevitably involve a fourfold
ambiguity. This is simply the freedom that we have already mentioned, to choose the four
coordinate functions throughout spacetime.

It is a straightforward but unenlightening exercise to sift through (4.83) to find that
not all second time derivatives of the metric appear. In fact we find that 97g;; appears in
(4.83), but not d?go,. Therefore a “state” in general relativity will consist of a specification
