1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 6
explicit expression for this six-parameter matrix (three boosts, three rotations) is not suffi-
ciently pretty or useful to bother writing down. In general Lorentz transformations will not
commute, so the Lorentz group is non-abelian. The set of both translations and Lorentz
transformations is a ten-parameter non-abelian group, the Poincaré group.

You should not be surprised to learn that the boosts correspond to changing coordinates
by moving to a frame which travels at a constant velocity, but let’s see it more explicitly.
For the transformation given by (1.18), the transformed coordinates ¢ and 2’ will be given
by

t' = tcosh¢ — xsinh¢
2’ = —tsinh¢+zcosho . (1.19)
From this we see that the point defined by 2/ = 0 is moving; it has a velocity
v= %: %:tanh(/b. (1.20)
To translate into more pedestrian notation, we can replace ¢ = tanh ™ v to obtain
t = Ay(t—wvz)
= ~(z—wvt) (1.21)
where v = 1/4/1 —v2. So indeed, our abstract approach has recovered the conventional
expressions for Lorentz transformations. Applying these formulae leads to time dilation,
length contraction, and so forth.

An extremely useful tool is the spacetime diagram, so let’s consider Minkowski space
from this point of view. We can begin by portraying the initial ¢ and = axes at (what are
conventionally thought of as) right angles, and suppressing the y and z axes. Then according
to (1.19), under a boost in the z-¢ plane the 2’ axis (¢’ = 0) is given by ¢ = x tanh ¢, while
the ¢ axis (2’ = 0) is given by ¢ = x/ tanh ¢. We therefore see that the space and time axes
are rotated into each other, although they scissor together instead of remaining orthogonal
in the traditional Euclidean sense. (As we shall see, the axes do in fact remain orthogonal
in the Lorentzian sense.) This should come as no surprise, since if spacetime behaved just
like a four-dimensional version of space the world would be a very different place.

It is also enlightening to consider the paths corresponding to travel at the speed ¢ = 1.
These are given in the original coordinate system by = +t. In the new system, a moment’s
thought reveals that the paths defined by 2’ = ' are precisely the same as those defined
by x = +t; these trajectories are left invariant under Lorentz transformations. Of course
we know that light travels at this speed; we have therefore found that the speed of light is
the same in any inertial frame. A set of points which are all connected to a single event by
