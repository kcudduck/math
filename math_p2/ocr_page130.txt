of the spacelike components of the metric g;;|; and their first time derivatives 0g;j|s. on the
hypersurface ¥, from which we can determine the future evolution using (4.83), up to an
unavoidable ambiguity in fixing the remaining components gp,. The situation is precisely
analogous to that in electromagnetism, where we know that no amount of initial data can
suffice to determine the evolution uniquely since there will always be the freedom to perform a
gauge transformation A, — A,+09,\. In general relativity, then, coordinate transformations
play a role reminiscent of gauge transformations in electromagnetism, in that they introduce
ambiguity into the time evolution.

One way to cope with this problem is to simply “choose a gauge.” In electromagnetism
this means to place a condition on the vector potential A,, which will restrict our freedom
to perform gauge transformations. For example we can choose Lorentz gauge, in which
VA" = 0, or temporal gauge, in which Ay = 0. We can do a similar thing in general
relativity, by fixing our coordinate system. A popular choice is harmonic gauge (also
known as Lorentz gauge and a host of other names), in which

Ozt =0. (4.84)
Here O = V#V,, is the covariant D’Alembertian, and it is crucial to realize when we take
the covariant derivative that the four functions z* are just functions, not components of a
vector. This condition is therefore simply
0 = 0Oz

A
= —g"T;, . (4.85)
In flat space, of course, Cartesian coordinates (in which F;‘U = 0) are harmonic coordi-
nates. (As a general principle, any function f which satisfies Of = 0 is called an “harmonic
function.”)

To see that this choice of coordinates successfully fixes our gauge freedom, let’s rewrite

the condition (4.84) in a somewhat simpler form. We have
PO 1 POV
g szr = 5.9 g (8;7961/ + aagvp - Q,QPU) ) (486)
from the definition of the Christoffel symbols. Meanwhile, from 9,(g"g,,) = 9,04 = 0 we
have

9" 0o = —Gor0pg"" . (4.87)
Also, from our previous exploration of the variation of the determinant of the metric (4.65),

we have 1 1
