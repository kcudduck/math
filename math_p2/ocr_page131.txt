Putting it all together, we find that (in general),
P = = O (459)
The harmonic gauge condition (4.85) therefore is equivalent to
Or(V=94") = 0. (490)
Taking the partial derivative of this with respect to ¢t = 2° yields
2 (
VT =~ | /)| (o)
This condition represents a second-order differential equation for the previously uncon-
strained metric components g%, in terms of the given initial data. We have therefore
succeeded in fixing our gauge freedom, in that we can now solve for the evolution of the
entire metric in harmonic coordinates. (At least locally; we have been glossing over the fact
our gauge choice may not be well-defined globally, and we would have to resort to working
in patches as usual. The same problem appears in gauge theories in particle physics.) Note
that we still have some freedom remaining; our gauge condition (4.84) restricts how the
coordinates stretch from our initial hypersurface ¥ throughout spacetime, but we can still
choose coordinates z' on ¥ however we like. This corresponds to the fact that making a
coordinate transformation z# — x* + 0, with O§* = 0, does not violate the harmonic gauge
condition.

We therefore have a well-defined initial value problem for general relativity; a state is
specified by the spacelike components of the metric and their time derivatives on a spacelike
hypersurface 3; given these, the spacelike components (4.83) of Einstein’s equations allow
us to evolve the metric forward in time, up to an ambiguity in coordinate choice which
may be resolved by choice of gauge. We must keep in mind that the initial data are not
arbitrary, but must obey the constraints (4.82). (Once we impose the constraints on some
spacelike hypersurface, the equations of motion guarantee that they remain satisfied, as you
can check.) The constraints serve a useful purpose, of guaranteeing that the result remains
spacetime covariant after we have split our manifold into “space” and “time.” Specifically,
the G = 87rGT™ constraint implies that the evolution is independent of our choice of
coordinates on X, while G = 87GTY enforces invariance under different ways of slicing
spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces.

Once we have seen how to cast Einstein’s equations as an initial value problem, one issue
of crucial importance is the existence of solutions to the problem. That is, once we have
specified a spacelike hypersurface with initial data, to what extent can we be guaranteed
that a unique spacetime will be determined? Although one can do a great deal of hard work
