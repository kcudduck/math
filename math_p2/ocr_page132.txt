to answer this question with some precision, it is fairly simple to get a handle on the ways
in which a well-defined solution can fail to exist, which we now consider.

It is simplest to first consider the problem of evolving matter fields on a fixed background
spacetime, rather than the evolution of the metric itself. We therefore consider a spacelike
hypersurface ¥ in some manifold M with fixed metric g,,, and furthermore look at some
connected subset S in ¥. Our guiding principle will be that no signals can travel faster than
the speed of light; therefore “information” will only flow along timelike or null trajectories
(not necessarily geodesics). We define the future domain of dependence of S, denoted
D7(S), as the set of all points p such that every past-moving, timelike or null, inextendible
curve through p must intersect S. (“Inextendible” just means that the curve goes on forever,
not ending at some finite point.) We interpret this definition in such a way that S itself is a
subset of D*(S). (Of course a rigorous formulation does not require additional interpretation
over and above the definitions, but we are not being as rigorous as we could be right now.)
Similarly, we define the past domain of dependence D~ (S) in the same way, but with “past-
moving” replaced by “future-moving.” Generally speaking, some points in M will be in one
of the domains of dependence, and some will be outside; we define the boundary of D*(S)
to be the future Cauchy horizon H*(S), and likewise the boundary of D~(S) to be the
past Cauchy horizon H~(S). You can convince yourself that they are both null surfaces.
