4 GRAVITATION 126

The usefulness of these definitions should be apparent; if nothing moves faster than light,
than signals cannot propagate outside the light cone of any point p. Therefore, if every
curve which remains inside this light cone must intersect S, then information specified on S
should be sufficient to predict what the situation is at p. (That is, initial data for matter
fields given on S can be used to solve for the value of the fields at p.) The set of all points
for which we can predict what happens by knowing what happens on S is simply the union
DT (S)u D~ (S).

We can easily extend these ideas from the subset S to the entire hypersurface 3. The
important point is that D (X) U D~ (X) might fail to be all of M, even if X itself seems like
a perfectly respectable hypersurface that extends throughout space. There are a number
of ways in which this can happen. One possibility is that we have just chosen a “bad”
hypersurface (although it is hard to give a general prescription for when a hypersurface is
bad in this sense). Consider Minkowski space, and a spacelike hypersurface ¥ which remains
to the past of the light cone of some point.

In this case ¥ is a nice spacelike surface, but it is clear that D*(X) ends at the light cone,
and we cannot use information on ¥ to predict what happens throughout Minkowski space.
Of course, there are other surfaces we could have picked for which the domain of dependence
would have been the entire manifold, so this doesn’t worry us too much.

A somewhat more nontrivial example is known as Misner space. This is a two-
dimensional spacetime with the topology of R! x S', and a metric for which the light cones
progressively tilt as you go forward in time. Past a certain point, it is possible to travel on a
timelike trajectory which wraps around the S! and comes back to itself; this is known as a
closed timelike curve. If we had specified a surface ¥ to this past of this point, then none
of the points in the region containing closed timelike curves are in the domain of dependence
of 3, since the closed timelike curves themselves do not intersect . This is obviously a worse
problem than the previous one, since a well-defined initial value problem does not seem to
