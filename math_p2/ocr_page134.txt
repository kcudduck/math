exist in this spacetime. (Actually problems like this are the subject of some current research
interest, so I won’t claim that the issue is settled.)

A final example is provided by the existence of singularities, points which are not in the
manifold even though they can be reached by travelling along a geodesic for a finite distance.
Typically these occur when the curvature becomes infinite at some point; if this happens,
the point can no longer be said to be part of the spacetime. Such an occurrence can lead to
the emergence of a Cauchy horizon — a point p which is in the future of a singularity cannot
be in the domain of dependence of a hypersurface to the past of the singularity, because
there will be curves from p which simply end at the singularity.

All of these obstacles can also arise in the initial value problem for GR, when we try to

evolve the metric itself from initial data. However, they are of different degrees of trouble-
