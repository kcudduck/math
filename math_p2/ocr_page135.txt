someness. The possibility of picking a “bad” initial hypersurface does not arise very often,
especially since most solutions are found globally (by solving Einstein’s equations throughout
spacetime). The one situation in which you have to be careful is in numerical solution of Ein-
stein’s equations, where a bad choice of hypersurface can lead to numerical difficulties even
if in principle a complete solution exists. Closed timelike curves seem to be something that
GR works hard to avoid — there are certainly solutions which contain them, but evolution
from generic initial data does not usually produce them. Singularities, on the other hand,
are practically unavoidable. The simple fact that the gravitational force is always attractive
tends to pull matter together, increasing the curvature, and generally leading to some sort of
singularity. This is something which we apparently must learn to live with, although there
is some hope that a well-defined theory of quantum gravity will eliminate the singularities
of classical GR.
