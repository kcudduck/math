5 More Geometry

With an understanding of how the laws of physics adapt to curved spacetime, it is undeniably
tempting to start in on applications. However, a few extra mathematical techniques will
simplify our task a great deal, so we will pause briefly to explore the geometry of manifolds
some more.

When we discussed manifolds in section 2, we introduced maps between two different
manifolds and how maps could be composed. We now turn to the use of such maps in carrying
along tensor fields from one manifold to another. We therefore consider two manifolds M
and N, possibly of different dimension, with coordinate systems z* and y®, respectively. We
imagine that we have a map ¢ : M — N and a function f: N — R.

It is obvious that we can compose ¢ with f to construct a map (f o ¢) : M — R, which is
simply a function on M. Such a construction is sufficiently useful that it gets its own name;
we define the pullback of f by ¢, denoted ¢, f, by

o.f=(fod). (5.1)
The name makes sense, since we think of ¢, as “pulling back” the function f from N to M.

We can pull functions back, but we cannot push them forward. If we have a function
g: M — R, there is no way we can compose g with ¢ to create a function on V; the arrows
don’t fit together correctly. But recall that a vector can be thought of as a derivative operator
that maps smooth functions to real numbers. This allows us to define the pushforward of
