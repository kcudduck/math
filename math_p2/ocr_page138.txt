That is, it is the same matrix as the pushforward (5.4), but of course a different index is
contracted when the matrix acts to pull back one-forms.

There is a way of thinking about why pullbacks and pushforwards work on some objects
but not others, which may or may not be helpful. If we denote the set of smooth functions
on M by F(M), then a vector V(p) at a point p on M (i.e., an element of the tangent space
T,M) can be thought of as an operator from F(M) to R. But we already know that the
pullback operator on functions maps F(N) to F(M) (just as ¢ itself maps M to N, but
in the opposite direction). Therefore we can define the pushforward ¢. acting on vectors
simply by composing maps, as we first defined the pullback of functions:

R
O"(V(p) = V(p) © 9,
V(p)
.
FM) = F(N)
Similarly, if 7, N is the tangent space at a point ¢ on N, then a one-form w at ¢ (i.e., an
element of the cotangent space T, N ) can be thought of as an operator from T, N to R. Since
the pushforward ¢* maps T, M to Ty N, the pullback ¢, of a one-form can also be thought
of as mere composition of maps:
R

If this is not helpful, don’t worry about it. But do keep straight what exists and what
doesn’t; the actual concepts are simple, it’s just remembering which map goes what way
that leads to confusion.

You will recall further that a (0,1) tensor — one with [ lower indices and no upper ones
— is a linear map from the direct product of [ vectors to R. We can therefore pull back
not only one-forms, but tensors with an arbitrary number of lower indices. The definition is
simply the action of the original tensor on the pushed-forward vectors:
