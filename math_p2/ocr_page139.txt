where T,, .., is a (0,1) tensor on N. We can similarly push forward any (k,0) tensor S#t#&
by acting it on pulled-back one-forms:
(¢*9) (M, w®, .. w®) = S(,wD, p,0® .. D™ . (5.8)
Fortunately, the matrix representations of the pushforward (5.4) and pullback (5.6) extend to
the higher-rank tensors simply by assigning one matrix to each index; thus, for the pullback
of a (0,1) tensor, we have

while for the pushforward of a (k,0) tensor we have

Our complete picture is therefore:

Note that tensors with both upper and lower indices can generally be neither pushed forward
nor pulled back.

This machinery becomes somewhat less imposing once we see it at work in a simple
example. One common occurrence of a map between two manifolds is when M is actually a
submanifold of N; then there is an obvious map from M to N which just takes an element
of M to the “same” element of N. Consider our usual example, the two-sphere embedded in
R3, as the locus of points a unit distance from the origin. If we put coordinates z# = (8, ¢)
on M = S% and y* = (2,y,2) on N = R3, the map ¢ : M — N is given by

(0, ) = (sin 6 cos ¢, sin fsin ¢, cos ) . (5.11)
In the past we have considered the metric ds* = da? + dy? + dz? on R?, and said that it
induces a metric d§? + sin? @ d¢? on S?, just by substituting (5.11) into this flat metric on
