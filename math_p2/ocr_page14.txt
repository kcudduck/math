straight lines moving at the speed of light is called a light cone; this entire set is invariant
under Lorentz transformations. Light cones are naturally divided into future and past; the
set of all points inside the future and past light cones of a point p are called timelike
separated from p, while those outside the light cones are spacelike separated and those
on the cones are lightlike or null separated from p. Referring back to (1.3), we see that the
interval between timelike separated points is negative, between spacelike separated points is
positive, and between null separated points is zero. (The interval is defined to be s2, not the
square root of this quantity.) Notice the distinction between this situation and that in the
Newtonian world; here, it is impossible to say (in a coordinate-independent way) whether a
point that is spacelike separated from p is in the future of p, the past of p, or “at the same
time”.

To probe the structure of Minkowski space in more detail, it is necessary to introduce
the concepts of vectors and tensors. We will start with vectors, which should be familiar. Of
course, in spacetime vectors are four-dimensional, and are often referred to as four-vectors.
This turns out to make quite a bit of difference; for example, there is no such thing as a
cross product between two four-vectors.

Beyond the simple fact of dimensionality, the most important thing to emphasize is that
each vector is located at a given point in spacetime. You may be used to thinking of vectors
as stretching from one point to another in space, and even of “free” vectors which you can
slide carelessly from point to point. These are not useful concepts in relativity. Rather, to
each point p in spacetime we associate the set of all possible vectors located at that point;
this set is known as the tangent space at p, or 7,,. The name is inspired by thinking of the
set of vectors attached to a point on a simple curved two-dimensional space as comprising a
