R?. We didn’t really justify such a statement at the time, but now we can do so. (Of course
it would be easier if we worked in spherical coordinates on R3, but doing it the hard way is
more illustrative.) The matrix of partial derivatives is given by

as you can easily check. Once again, the answer is the same as you would get by naive
substitution, but now we know why.

We have been careful to emphasize that a map ¢ : M — N can be used to push certain
things forward and pull other things back. The reason why it generally doesn’t work both
ways can be traced to the fact that ¢ might not be invertible. If ¢ is invertible (and both ¢
and ¢! are smooth, which we always implicitly assume), then it defines a diffeomorphism
between M and N. In this case M and N are the same abstract manifold. The beauty of
diffeomorphisms is that we can use both ¢ and ¢! to move tensors from M to N; this will
allow us to define the pushforward and pullback of arbitrary tensors. Specifically, for a (k, 1)
tensor field T#1#*,, ., on M, we define the pushforward by

(@ T)(w®, ..., w® VO VO = T(pw®, . pw® o7 VD e V)

(5.14)
where the w@’s are one-forms on N and the V@’s are vectors on N. In components this
becomes oy Dy O P

The appearance of the inverse matrix dz”/dy® is legitimate because ¢ is invertible. Note
that we could also define the pullback in the obvious way, but there is no need to write
separate equations because the pullback ¢, is the same as the pushforward via the inverse
map, [¢71]*.

We are now in a position to explain the relationship between diffeomorphisms and coordi-
nate transformations. The relationship is that they are two different ways of doing precisely
the same thing. If you like, diffeomorphisms are “active coordinate transformations”, while
traditional coordinate transformations are “passive.” Consider an n-dimensional manifold
M with coordinate functions x* : M — R"™. To change coordinates we can either simply
introduce new functions y* : M — R"™ (“keep the manifold fixed, change the coordinate
