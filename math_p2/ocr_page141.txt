maps”), or we could just as well introduce a diffeomorphism ¢ : M — M, after which the
coordinates would just be the pullbacks (¢.2)* : M — R™ (“move the points on the man-
ifold, and then evaluate the coordinates of the new points”). In this sense, (5.15) really is
the tensor transformation law, just thought of from a different point of view.

Since a diffeomorphism allows us to pull back and push forward arbitrary tensors, it
provides another way of comparing tensors at different points on a manifold. Given a diffeo-
morphism ¢ : M — M and a tensor field T+ #,, ., (), we can form the difference between
the value of the tensor at some point p and @.[T" " #,, ..., (¢(p))], its value at ¢(p) pulled
back to p. This suggests that we could define another kind of derivative operator on tensor
fields, one which categorizes the rate of change of the tensor as it changes under the diffeo-
morphism. For that, however, a single discrete diffeomorphism is insufficient; we require a
one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, ¢;. This family can be thought of as a smooth
map R x M — M, such that for each t € R ¢, is a diffeomorphism and ¢ 0 ¢, = ¢+;. Note
that this last condition implies that ¢ is the identity map.

One-parameter families of diffeomorphisms can be thought of as arising from vector fields
(and vice-versa). If we consider what happens to the point p under the entire family ¢y, it is
clear that it describes a curve in M; since the same thing will be true of every point on M,
these curves fill the manifold (although there can be degeneracies where the diffeomorphisms
have fixed points). We can define a vector field V#(z) to be the set of tangent vectors to
each of these curves at every point, evaluated at t = 0. An example on S? is provided by
the diffeomorphism ¢(0, ¢) = (0, ¢ + ).

We can reverse the construction to define a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms
from any vector field. Given a vector field V#(z), we define the integral curves of the
vector field to be those curves x#(t) which solve

Note that this familiar-looking equation is now to be interpreted in the opposite sense from
our usual way — we are given the vectors, from which we define the curves. Solutions to
