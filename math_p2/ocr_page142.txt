(5.16) are guaranteed to exist as long as we don’t do anything silly like run into the edge of
our manifold; any standard differential geometry text will have the proof, which amounts to
finding a clever coordinate system in which the problem reduces to the fundamental theorem
of ordinary differential equations. Our diffeomorphisms ¢, represent “flow down the integral
curves,” and the associated vector field is referred to as the generator of the diffeomorphism.
(Integral curves are used all the time in elementary physics, just not given the name. The
“lines of magnetic flux” traced out by iron filings in the presence of a magnet are simply the
integral curves of the magnetic field vector B.)
Given a vector field V#(z), then, we have a family of diffeomorphisms parameterized by
t, and we can ask how fast a tensor changes as we travel down the integral curves. For each
t we can define this change as
AtTulmukvl“'M (p) = Qbi*[Tmm#er“M(¢i(p))] - T/—LI"'/—kal_“M(p) . (517)
Note that both terms on the right hand side are tensors at p.

We then define the Lie derivative of the tensor along the vector field as
