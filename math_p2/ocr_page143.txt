The Lie derivative is a map from (k, ) tensor fields to (k, 1) tensor fields, which is manifestly
independent of coordinates. Since the definition essentially amounts to the conventional
definition of an ordinary derivative applied to the component functions of the tensor, it
should be clear that it is linear,

£Lv(@T+bS)=afyvT+bLyS (5.19)
and obeys the Leibniz rule,

Ly(TRS =Ly T)RS+T®(£LvS), (5.20)
where S and 7" are tensors and a and b are constants. The Lie derivative is in fact a more
primitive notion than the covariant derivative, since it does not require specification of a
connection (although it does require a vector field, of course). A moment’s reflection shows
that it reduces to the ordinary derivative on functions,

Lyf=V(f)=VHI.f . (5.21)
To discuss the action of the Lie derivative on tensors in terms of other operations we
know, it is convenient to choose a coordinate system adapted to our problem. Specifically,
we will work in coordinates z# for which x! is the parameter along the integral curves (and
the other coordinates are chosen any way we like). Then the vector field takes the form
V = 9/0z"; that is, it has components V* = (1,0,0,...,0). The magic of this coordinate
system is that a diffeomorphism by ¢ amounts to a coordinate transformation from z* to
y* = (2! +t,2%,...,2"). Thus, from (5.6) the pullback matrix is simply
(Br)” =0y, (5.22)
and the components of the tensor pulled back from ¢;(p) to p are simply
Gue[TH % (De(p))] = T, (2t 2%, ") (5.23)
In this coordinate system, then, the Lie derivative becomes

£y T view = o7 T Vi s (5.24)
and specifically the derivative of a vector field U¥(z) is
our
Ly Ut = —. 5.25
v ox! (5:25)
Although this expression is clearly not covariant, we know that the commutator [V, U] is a
well-defined tensor, and in this coordinate system
v, o = vvo,ur-U"9,v*
