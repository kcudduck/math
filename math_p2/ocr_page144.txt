Therefore the Lie derivative of U with respect to V' has the same components in this coordi-
nate system as the commutator of V' and U; but since both are vectors, they must be equal
in any coordinate system:

£y Ut =[V,U". (5.27)

As an immediate consequence, we have £y S = —£Ly V. It is because of (5.27) that the
commutator is sometimes called the “Lie bracket.”

To derive the action of £ on a one-form w,, begin by considering the action on the
scalar w,U* for an arbitrary vector field U*. First use the fact that the Lie derivative with
respect to a vector field reduces to the action of the vector itself when applied to a scalar:

Ly(w, 0" = V(w,U")
= V"0,(w,U")
= VY(0w,)U" +V'w,(8,U") . (5.28)
Then use the Leibniz rule on the original scalar:
Ly(w, 0" = (£yw) " +w (£v U
= (Lyw), U"+w, V"0, U" —w,U"0, V" . (5.29)
Setting these expressions equal to each other and requiring that equality hold for arbitrary
U", we see that
Lywy, = V"0,wy+ (0, V" )w, , (5.30)
which (like the definition of the commutator) is completely covariant, although not manifestly
S0.
By a similar procedure we can define the Lie derivative of an arbitrary tensor field. The
answer can be written
Ly TMmeuwg~-t/r = V“&,T“‘M'““‘"W,,2.._,,l
_(a)\vﬂl)T/\H‘Z“'ﬂkmuzmw _ (aﬂ/uz)Tu1A-~-uk”w2_w ...
F(D, VAYTHb by A (9, VTR A (5.31)
Once again, this expression is covariant, despite appearances. It would undoubtedly be
comforting, however, to have an equivalent expression that looked manifestly tensorial. In
fact it turns out that we can write

£y Trree, = VOV TH# e,
