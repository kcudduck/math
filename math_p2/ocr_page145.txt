5 MORE GEOMETRY 138
where V,, represents any symmetric (torsion-free) covariant derivative (including, of course,
one derived from a metric). You can check that all of the terms which would involve connec-
tion coefficients if we were to expand (5.32) would cancel, leaving only (5.31). Both versions
of the formula for a Lie derivative are useful at different times. A particularly useful formula
is for the Lie derivative of the metric:
£V!];n/ = ngrrg;w + (VHVA)Q/\,, + (V,,V’\)y;,)‘

= V.V, +V,V,

= 2V, (5.33)
where V,, is the covariant derivative derived from g,,.

Let’s put some of these ideas into the context of general relativity. You will often hear it
proclaimed that GR is a “diffeomorphism invariant” theory. What this means is that, if the
universe is represented by a manifold M with metric g, and matter fields ¢, and ¢ : M —
M is a diffeomorphism, then the sets (M, g, ¢) and (M, ¢.g,., ¢«1) represent the same
physical situation. Since diffeomorphisms are just active coordinate transformations, this is
a highbrow way of saying that the theory is coordinate invariant. Although such a statement
is true, it is a source of great misunderstanding, for the simple fact that it conveys very little
information. Any semi-respectable theory of physics is coordinate invariant, including those
based on special relativity or Newtonian mechanics; GR is not unique in this regard. When
people say that GR is diffeomorphism invariant, more likely than not they have one of two
(closely related) concepts in mind: the theory is free of “prior geometry”, and there is no
preferred coordinate system for spacetime. The first of these stems from the fact that the
metric is a dynamical variable, and along with it the connection and volume element and
so forth. Nothing is given to us ahead of time, unlike in classical mechanics or SR. As
a consequence, there is no way to simplify life by sticking to a specific coordinate system
adapted to some absolute elements of the geometry. This state of affairs forces us to be very
careful; it is possible that two purportedly distinct configurations (of matter and metric)
in GR are actually “the same”, related by a diffeomorphism. In a path integral approach
to quantum gravity, where we would like to sum over all possible configurations, special
care must be taken not to overcount by allowing physically indistinguishable configurations
to contribute more than once. In SR or Newtonian mechanics, meanwhile, the existence
of a preferred set of coordinates saves us from such ambiguities. The fact that GR has no
preferred coordinate system is often garbled into the statement that it is coordinate invariant
(or “generally covariant”); both things are true, but one has more content than the other.

On the other hand, the fact of diffeomorphism invariance can be put to good use. Recall
that the complete action for gravity coupled to a set of matter fields ¢ is given by a sum of
the Hilbert action for GR plus the matter action,
