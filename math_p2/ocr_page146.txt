The Hilbert action Sy is diffeomorphism invariant when considered in isolation, so the matter
action Sj; must also be if the action as a whole is to be invariant. We can write the variation
in Sy under a diffeomorphism as
0Snm OSM 4
0Su = [ da M ogu, + [ da oyt 5.35
= g oo | s (539
We are not considering arbitrary variations of the fields, only those which result from a
diffeomorphism. Nevertheless, the matter equations of motion tell us that the variation of
Sy with respect to ¢ will vanish for any variation (since the gravitational part of the action
doesn’t involve the matter fields). Hence, for a diffeomorphism invariant theory the first
term on the right hand side of (5.35) must vanish. If the diffeomorphism in generated by a
vector field V#(z), the infinitesimal change in the metric is simply given by its Lie derivative
along V*#; by (5.33) we have
§guu = -”é)Vguu
= 2VyV, . (5.36)
Setting 65y = 0 then implies

/ S V=909 ( )
where we are able to drop the symmetrization of V(,V, since §Sy;/0g,,, is already symmetric.
Demanding that (5.37) hold for diffeomorphisms generated by arbitrary vector fields V#, and
using the definition (4.70) of the energy-momentum tensor, we obtain precisely the law of
energy-momentum conservation,
v, =0. (5.38)
This is why we claimed earlier that the conservation of 7}, was more than simply a conse-
quence of the Principle of Equivalence; it is much more secure than that, resting only on the
diffeomorphism invariance of the theory.

There is one more use to which we will put the machinery we have set up in this section:
symmetries of tensors. We say that a diffeomorphism ¢ is a symmetry of some tensor 7" if
the tensor is invariant after being pulled back under ¢:

oI =T. (5.39)
Although symmetries may be discrete, it is more common to have a one-parameter family
of symmetries ¢;. If the family is generated by a vector field V#(x), then (5.39) amounts to
£yT=0. (5.40)
