5 MORE GEOMETRY 140
By (5.25), one implication of a symmetry is that, if 7' is symmetric under some one-parameter
family of diffeomorphisms, we can always find a coordinate system in which the components
of T are all independent of one of the coordinates (the integral curve coordinate of the
vector field). The converse is also true; if all of the components are independent of one
of the coordinates, then the partial derivative vector field associated with that coordinate
generates a symmetry of the tensor.

The most important symmetries are those of the metric, for which ¢.g., = gu. A
diffeomorphism of this type is called an isometry. If a one-parameter family of isometries
is generated by a vector field V#(x), then V# is known as a Killing vector field. The
condition that V* be a Killing vector is thus
or from (5.33),

ViV =0. (5.42)
This last version is Killing’s equation. If a spacetime has a Killing vector, then we know
we can find a coordinate system in which the metric is independent of one of the coordinates.

By far the most useful fact about Killing vectors is that Killing vectors imply conserved
quantities associated with the motion of free particles. If z*(\) is a geodesic with tangent
vector UF = da#/d), and V* is a Killing vector, then

urv,(v,u" = U'Urv,V,+V,U'v,u*

=0, (5.43)
where the first term vanishes from Killing’s equation and the second from the fact that z#(\)
is a geodesic. Thus, the quantity V,U* is conserved along the particle’s worldline. This can
be understood physically: by definition the metric is unchanging along the direction of
the Killing vector. Loosely speaking, therefore, a free particle will not feel any “forces” in
this direction, and the component of its momentum in that direction will consequently be
conserved.

Long ago we referred to the concept of a space with maximal symmetry, without offering
a rigorous definition. The rigorous definition is that a maximally symmetric space is one
which possesses the largest possible number of Killing vectors, which on an n-dimensional
manifold is n(n + 1)/2. We will not prove this statement, but it is easy to understand at an
informal level. Consider the Euclidean space R"™, where the isometries are well known to us:
translations and rotations. In general there will be n translations, one for each direction we
can move. There will also be n(n — 1)/2 rotations; for each of n dimensions there are n — 1
directions in which we can rotate it, but we must divide by two to prevent overcounting
(rotating x into y and rotating y into x are two versions of the same thing). We therefore
