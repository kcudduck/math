independent Killing vectors. The same kind of counting argument applies to maximally
symmetric spaces with curvature (such as spheres) or a non-Euclidean signature (such as
Minkowski space), although the details are marginally different.

Although it may or may not be simple to actually solve Killing’s equation in any given
spacetime, it is frequently possible to write down some Killing vectors by inspection. (Of
course a “generic” metric has no Killing vectors at all, but to keep things simple we often deal
with metrics with high degrees of symmetry.) For example in R? with metric ds? = da?+dy?,
independence of the metric components with respect to x and y immediately yields two
Killing vectors:

Xr = (L0),

Yy = (0,1). (5.45)
These clearly represent the two translations. The one rotation would correspond to the
vector R = 9/00 if we were in polar coordinates; in Cartesian coordinates this becomes

R = (—y,x) . (5.46)
You can check for yourself that this actually does solve Killing’s equation.

Note that in n > 2 dimensions, there can be more Killing vectors than dimensions. This
is because a set of Killing vector fields can be linearly independent, even though at any one
point on the manifold the vectors at that point are linearly dependent. It is trivial to show
(so you should do it yourself) that a linear combination of Killing vectors with constant
coefficients is still a Killing vector (in which case the linear combination does not count as
an independent Killing vector), but this is not necessarily true with coefficients which vary
over the manifold. You will also show that the commutator of two Killing vector fields is a
Killing vector field; this is very useful to know, but it may be the case that the commutator
gives you a vector field which is not linearly independent (or it may simply vanish). The
problem of finding all of the Killing vectors of a metric is therefore somewhat tricky, as it is
sometimes not clear when to stop looking.
