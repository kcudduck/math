6 Weak Fields and Gravitational Radiation
When we first derived Einstein’s equations, we checked that we were on the right track by
considering the Newtonian limit. This amounted to the requirements that the gravitational
field be weak, that it be static (no time derivatives), and that test particles be moving slowly.
In this section we will consider a less restrictive situation, in which the field is still weak but
it can vary with time, and there are no restrictions on the motion of test particles. This
will allow us to discuss phenomena which are absent or ambiguous in the Newtonian theory,
such as gravitational radiation (where the field varies with time) and the deflection of light
(which involves fast-moving particles).
The weakness of the gravitational field is once again expressed as our ability to decompose
the metric into the flat Minkowski metric plus a small perturbation,
v = Mv + Py || << 1. (6.1)
We will restrict ourselves to coordinates in which 7, takes its canonical form, 7,, =
diag(—1,+1,+1,41). The assumption that %, is small allows us to ignore anything that is
higher than first order in this quantity, from which we immediately obtain
g =t = h (6.2)
where h#" = n#*n*?h,,. As before, we can raise and lower indices using n** and 1), since
the corrections would be of higher order in the perturbation. In fact, we can think of
the linearized version of general relativity (where effects of higher than first order in hy,
are neglected) as describing a theory of a symmetric tensor field h,, propagating on a flat
background spacetime. This theory is Lorentz invariant in the sense of special relativity;
under a Lorentz transformation z# = A# u2*, the flat metric 7, is invariant, while the
perturbation transforms as
By = K" AP hy,, (6.3)
(Note that we could have considered small perturbations about some other background
spacetime besides Minkowski space. In that case the metric would have been written g,, =
gff)u) + hyu, and we would have derived a theory of a symmetric tensor propagating on the
curved space with metric gff,),). Such an approach is necessary, for example, in cosmology.)
We want to find the equation of motion obeyed by the perturbations ,,,, which come by
examining Einstein’s equations to first order. We begin with the Christoffel symbols, which
are given by
