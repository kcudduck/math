vectors as being located at a single point, rather than stretching from one point to another.

Later we will relate the tangent space at each point to things we can construct from the
spacetime itself. For right now, just think of 7}, as an abstract vector space for each point
in spacetime. A (real) vector space is a collection of objects (“vectors”) which, roughly
speaking, can be added together and multiplied by real numbers in a linear way. Thus, for
any two vectors V' and W and real numbers a and b, we have

(a+D0)(V+W)=aV +bV +aW + bW . (1.22)
Every vector space has an origin, i.e. a zero vector which functions as an identity element
under vector addition. In many vector spaces there are additional operations such as taking
an inner (dot) product, but this is extra structure over and above the elementary concept of
a vector space.

A vector is a perfectly well-defined geometric object, as is a vector field, defined as a
set of vectors with exactly one at each point in spacetime. (The set of all the tangent spaces
of a manifold M is called the tangent bundle, T(M).) Nevertheless it is often useful for
concrete purposes to decompose vectors into components with respect to some set of basis
vectors. A basis is any set of vectors which both spans the vector space (any vector is
a linear combination of basis vectors) and is linearly independent (no vector in the basis
is a linear combination of other basis vectors). For any given vector space, there will be
an infinite number of legitimate bases, but each basis will consist of the same number of
