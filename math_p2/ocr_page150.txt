6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 143
= 1P @uhur + O — 6.4
= (Ouhur + Ouhiny = Oahywy) - (6.4)
Since the connection coefficients are first order quantities, the only contribution to the Rie-
mann tensor will come from the derivatives of the I'’s, not the I'? terms. Lowering an index
for convenience, we obtain
Ruvpe = 10,0 L\n - 7IuAavF3p
1 (
= 5(0[,8,,}1,;", + 0501w — 0,0, hyp — 0,0,h05) - (6.5)
The Ricci tensor comes from contracting over p and p, giving
R, = E(d(,auh"u +0,0,h7, — 8,0,h — Ohy,) , (6.6)
which is manifestly symmetric in g and v. In this expression we have defined the trace of
the perturbation as h = n*"h,, = h*,, and the D’Alembertian is simply the one from flat
space, O = —87 + 87 + 92 + 92. Contracting again to obtain the Ricci scalar yields
R =0,0,h"” —Oh . (6.7)
Putting it all together we obtain the Einstein tensor:
1
G;w = R;u/ - inuvR
1
= 5(&,8,,]#’“ + 0,0,h7, — 0,0,h — Ohpy — 0,,0,0,W" + 1, 0h) . (6.8)
Consistent with our interpretation of the linearized theory as one describing a symmetric
tensor on a flat background, the linearized Einstein tensor (6.8) can be derived by varying
the following Lagrangian with respect to hy,:
1 v po I 1 v po 1 v
L= 3 (0,0")(0,h) — (D7) (0, 5) + 3" (0,h*) (O hpo) — BX (0.h)(0,h)] . (6.9)
I will spare you the details.

The linearized field equation is of course G,, = 87GT,,,, where G, is given by (6.8)
and T}, is the energy-momentum tensor, calculated to zeroth order in h,,. We do not
include higher-order corrections to the energy-momentum tensor because the amount of
energy and momentum must itself be small for the weak-field limit to apply. In other words,
the lowest nonvanishing order in 7}, is automatically of the same order of magnitude as the
perturbation. Notice that the conservation law to lowest order is simply 9,7 = 0. We will
most often be concerned with the vacuum equations, which as usual are just R, = 0, where
Ry, is given by (6.6).
