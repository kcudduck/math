6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 144

With the linearized field equations in hand, we are almost prepared to set about solving
them. First, however, we should deal with the thorny issue of gauge invariance. This issue
arises because the demand that g,, = 1., + h, does not completely specify the coordinate
system on spacetime; there may be other coordinate systems in which the metric can still
be written as the Minkowski metric plus a small perturbation, but the perturbation will be
different. Thus, the decomposition of the metric into a flat background plus a perturbation
is not unique.

We can think about this from a highbrow point of view. The notion that the linearized
theory can be thought of as one governing the behavior of tensor fields on a flat background
can be formalized in terms of a “background spacetime” M,, a “physical spacetime” My,
and a diffeomorphism ¢ : M, — M,. As manifolds M, and M, are “the same” (since
they are diffeomorphic), but we imagine that they possess some different tensor fields; on
M, we have defined the flat Minkowski metric 7),,, while on M, we have some metric g.s
which obeys Einstein’s equations. (We imagine that M, is equipped with coordinates 2 and
M, is equipped with coordinates y®, although these will not play a prominent role.) The
diffeomorphism ¢ allows us to move tensors back and forth between the background and
physical spacetimes. Since we would like to construct our linearized theory as one taking
place on the flat background spacetime, we are interested in the pullback (¢.g)., of the
physical metric. We can define the perturbation as the difference between the pulled-back
physical metric and the flat one:

hyw = (049)jr — o - (6.10)
From this definition, there is no reason for the components of h,, to be small; however, if the
gravitational fields on M, are weak, then for some diffeomorphisms ¢ we will have |hy, | << 1.
We therefore limit our attention only to those diffecomorphisms for which this is true. Then
the fact that g, obeys Einstein’s equations on the physical spacetime means that h,, will
obey the linearized equations on the background spacetime (since ¢, as a diffeomorphism,
can be used to pull back Einstein’s equations themselves).

In this language, the issue of gauge invariance is simply the fact that there are a large

number of permissible diffeomorphisms between M, and M, (where “permissible” means
