This vector field generates a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms v, : M, — M,. For
e sufficiently small, if ¢ is a diffeomorphism for which the perturbation defined by (6.10) is
small than so will (¢ o 1),) be, although the perturbation will have a different value.

Specifically, we can define a family of perturbations parameterized by e:
hﬁfu) = [(po we)*g]w — N
= [wf*(¢*g)]uu — Nuv - (6'11)
The second equality is based on the fact that the pullback under a composition is given by
the composition of the pullbacks in the opposite order, which follows from the fact that the
pullback itself moves things in the opposite direction from the original map. Plugging in the
relation (6.10), we find
hifu) = Ve + M — My
= Yallyu) + Ve () — M (6.12)
(since the pullback of the sum of two tensors is the sum of the pullbacks). Now we use our
assumption that e is small; in this case 1he.(hy,,) will be equal to hy,, to lowest order, while
the other two terms give us a Lie derivative:

The last equality follows from our previous computation of the Lie derivative of the metric,
(5.33), plus the fact that covariant derivatives are simply partial derivatives to lowest order.
The infinitesimal diffeomorphisms ¢, provide a different representation of the same phys-
ical situation, while maintaining our requirement that the perturbation be small. Therefore,
the result (6.12) tells us what kind of metric perturbations denote physically equivalent
spacetimes — those related to each other by 2¢9;,&,), for some vector £#. The invariance of
