6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 146
our theory under such transformations is analogous to traditional gauge invariance of elec-
tromagnetism under A, — A, + 9, X. (The analogy is different from the previous analogy
we drew with electromagnetism, relating local Lorentz transformations in the orthonormal-
frame formalism to changes of basis in an internal vector bundle.) In electromagnetism the
invariance comes about because the field strength F,, = d,A, — 0,4, is left unchanged
by gauge transformations; similarly, we find that the transformation (6.13) changes the lin-
earized Riemann tensor by
ORpe = %(0[,8,,6;150 + 0,000, + 050,0,€, + 0,0,0,&,
—0,0,0,6) — 050,0,€, — 0,0,0,€5 — 0,0,056,)

= 0. (6.14)
Our abstract derivation of the appropriate gauge transformation for the metric perturba-
tion is verified by the fact that it leaves the curvature (and hence the physical spacetime)
unchanged.

Gauge invariance can also be understood from the slightly more lowbrow but considerably
more direct route of infinitesimal coordinate transformations. Our diffeomorphism . can
be thought of as changing coordinates from z# to z* — €. (The minus sign, which is
unconventional, comes from the fact that the “new” metric is pulled back from a small
distance forward along the integral curves, which is equivalent to replacing the coordinates
by those a small distance backward along the curves.) Following through the usual rules for
transforming tensors under coordinate transformations, you can derive precisely (6.13) —
although you have to cheat somewhat by equating components of tensors in two different
coordinate systems. See Schutz or Weinberg for an example.

When faced with a system that is invariant under some kind of gauge transformations,
our first instinct is to fix a gauge. We have already discussed the harmonic coordinate
system, and will return to it now in the context of the weak field limit. Recall that this
gauge was specified by Oz# = 0, which we showed was equivalent to

gy, =0. (6.15)
In the weak field limit this becomes
%n“”n*”@hm + Oohay — Onhpw) =0, (6.16)
or 1
Ouht's — EOAh =0. (6.17)
This condition is also known as Lorentz gauge (or Einstein gauge or Hilbert gauge or de Don-
der gauge or Fock gauge). As before, we still have some gauge freedom remaining, since we
can change our coordinates by (infinitesimal) harmonic functions.
