6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 147
In this gauge, the linearized Einstein equations G, = 87GT),, simplify somewhat, to
1
Ohy — §T/WD}L = —167GT,, . (6.18)
while the vacuum equations R, = 0 take on the elegant form
Ohw =0, (6.19)
which is simply the conventional relativistic wave equation. Together, (6.19) and (6.17)
determine the evolution of a disturbance in the gravitational field in vacuum in the harmonic
gauge.
It is often convenient to work with a slightly different description of the metric pertur-
bation. We define the “trace-reversed” perturbation Bw by
- 1
The name makes sense, since h*, = —h*,. (The Einstein tensor is simply the trace-reversed
Ricci tensor.) In terms of l_lw the harmonic gauge condition becomes
O.h*\ =0 (6.21)
The full field equations are
Ohy, = —167GT,, | (6.22)
from which it follows immediately that the vacuum equations are
Oh,, =0 . (6.23)
From (6.22) and our previous exploration of the Newtonian limit, it is straightforward to
derive the weak-field metric for a stationary spherical source such as a planet or star. Recall
that previously we found that Einstein’s equations predicted that hgy obeyed the Poisson
equation (4.51) in the weak-field limit, which implied
hoo = —2P | (6.24)
where @ is the conventional Newtonian potential, ® = —GM/r. Let us now assume that
the energy-momentum tensor of our source is dominated by its rest energy density p = Too.
(Such an assumption is not generally necessary in the weak-field limit, but will certainly
hold for a planet or star, which is what we would like to consider for the moment.) Then
the other components of 7}, will be much smaller than Ty, and from (6.22) the same must
hold for Euw- If hgo is much larger than ;I,ij. we will have
h=—h= —’r/‘“’}ilw = hoo , (6.25)
