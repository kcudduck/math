6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 148
and then from (6.20) we immediately obtain
hoo = 2hgg = —4® . (6.26)
The other components of 71“,, are negligible, from which we can derive

The metric for a star or planet in the weak-field limit is therefore
ds? = —(1+20)dt? 4 (1 — 2®)(da? + dy* + dz?) . (6.29)
A somewhat less simplistic application of the weak-field limit is to gravitational radiation.
Those of you familiar with the analogous problem in electromagnetism will notice that the
procedure is almost precisely the same. We begin by considering the linearized equations in
vacuum (6.23). Since the flat-space D’Alembertian has the form O = —9? + V2, the field
equation is in the form of a wave equation for B;w- As all good physicists know, the thing to
do when faced with such an equation is to write down complex-valued solutions, and then
take the real part at the very end of the day. So we recognize that a particularly useful set
of solutions to this wave equation are the plane waves, given by
Py = Cpe®e™” (6.30)
where C, is a constant, symmetric, (0,2) tensor, and k” is a constant vector known as the
wave vector. To check that it is a solution, we plug in:
0 = Oh,,
= 170,05 by
= 00, (ikohyu,)
= =" kpkohyu
= kR, (6.31)
Since (for an interesting solution) not all of the components of hyuw will be zero everywhere,
we must have
kok® =0 . (6.32)
The plane wave (6.30) is therefore a solution to the linearized equations if the wavevector
is null; this is loosely translated into the statement that gravitational waves propagate at
the speed of light. The timelike component of the wave vector is often referred to as the
