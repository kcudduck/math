frequency of the wave, and we write k% = (w, k', k% k®). (More generally, an observer
moving with four-velocity U* would observe the wave to have a frequency w = —k,U".)
Then the condition that the wave vector be null becomes

w? =6,k . (6.33)
Of course our wave is far from the most general solution; any (possibly infinite) number of
distinct plane waves can be added together and will still solve the linear equation (6.23).
Indeed, any solution can be written as such a superposition.

There are a number of free parameters to specify the wave: ten numbers for the coefficients
C,w and three for the null vector k?. Much of these are the result of coordinate freedom and
gauge freedom, which we now set about eliminating. We begin by imposing the harmonic
gauge condition, (6.21). This implies that

0 = 9,h"
— a“(cuueikaz”)
= iC"k,e* (6.34)
which is only true if
k,C" =0 . (6.35)
We say that the wave vector is orthogonal to C*”. These are four equations, which reduce
the number of independent components of €y, from ten to six.

Although we have now imposed the harmonic gauge condition, there is still some coor-

dinate freedom left. Remember that any coordinate transformation of the form
at — a4 M (6.36)
will leave the harmonic coordinate condition
Oxk =0 (6.37)
satisfied as long as we have
ack=0. (6.38)
Of course, (6.38) is itself a wave equation for (*; once we choose a solution, we will have
used up all of our gauge freedom. Let’s choose the following solution:
G = B, (6.39)
where k, is the wave vector for our gravitational wave and the B, are constant coefficients.

We now claim that this remaining freedom allows us to convert from whatever coefficients

CL‘;ld) that characterize our gravitational wave to a new set CL‘;GW), such that
Cwewlk =0 (6.40)
