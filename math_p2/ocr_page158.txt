To check that these choices are mutually consistent, we should plug (6.48) and (6.50) back
into (6.40), which I will leave to you. Let us assume that we have performed this transfor-
mation, and refer to the new components Clﬂf;ew) simply as Cp,.

Thus, we began with the ten independent numbers in the symmetric matrix C,,,. Choos-
ing harmonic gauge implied the four conditions (6.35), which brought the number of indepen-
dent components down to six. Using our remaining gauge freedom led to the one condition
(6.40) and the four conditions (6.41); but when v = 0 (6.41) implies (6.35), so we have a
total of four additional constraints, which brings us to two independent components. We've
used up all of our possible freedom, so these two numbers represent the physical information
characterizing our plane wave in this gauge. This can be seen more explicitly by choosing
our spatial coordinates such that the wave is travelling in the 2® direction; that is,

k= (w,0,0,k% = (w,0,0,w) , (6.51)
where we know that k&* = w because the wave vector is null. In this case, k*C, = 0 and
Co, = 0 together imply

Cs =0. (6.52)
The only nonzero components of C,, are therefore Ci1, Cia, Coi, and Cy. But C is
traceless and symmetric, so in general we can write
0 0 0 0
_ 0 Cll Clg 0
C = 0 Cn —Cy 0] - (6.53)
0 0 0 0
Thus, for a plane wave in this gauge travelling in the z*® direction, the two components C;
and C)2 (along with the frequency w) completely characterize the wave.

In using up all of our gauge freedom, we have gone to a subgauge of the harmonic gauge
known as the transverse traceless gauge (or sometimes “radiation gauge”). The name
comes from the fact that the metric perturbation is traceless and perpendicular to the wave
vector. Of course, we have been working with the trace-reversed perturbation B;,,, rather
than the perturbation h,,, itself; but since B;,,, is traceless (because C, is), and is equal to
the trace-reverse of h,,, in this gauge we have

EE”T = }I,E”T (transverse traceless gauge) . (6.54)
Therefore we can drop the bars over h,,,, as long as we are in this gauge.
