6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 152
One nice feature of the transverse traceless gauge is that if you are given the components
of a plane wave in some arbitrary gauge, you can easily convert them into the transverse
traceless components. We first define a tensor P, which acts as a projection operator:
P;w = Nuv — NNy - (655)
You can check that this projects vectors onto hyperplanes orthogonal to the unit vector n,,.
Here we take n, to be a spacelike unit vector, which we choose to lie along the direction of
propagation of the wave:
ng=0, nj=kj/w. (6.56)
Then the transverse part of some perturbation h, is simply the projection F,”P,%h,q, and
the transverse traceless part is obtained by subtracting off the trace:

h;fz:r = Puppvghpa - §Puuppghpa . (6.57)
For details appropriate to more general cases, see the discussion in Misner, Thorne and
Wheeler.

To get a feeling for the physical effects due to gravitational waves, it is useful to consider
the motion of test particles in the presence of a wave. It is certainly insufficient to solve
for the trajectory of a single particle, since that would only tell us about the values of
the coordinates along the world line. (In fact, for any single particle we can find transverse
traceless coordinates in which the particle appears stationary to first order in hy,,,.) To obtain
a coordinate-independent measure of the wave’s effects, we consider the relative motion of
nearby particles, as described by the geodesic deviation equation. If we consider some nearby
particles with four-velocities described by a single vector field U#(x) and separation vector
S*, we have

D2
FS“ =R, ,,UUPS? . (6.58)
We would like to compute the left-hand side to first order in hy,. If we take our test
particles to be moving slowly then we can express the four-velocity as a unit vector in the
time direction plus corrections of order h,, and higher; but we know that the Riemann tensor
is already first order, so the corrections to U” may be ignored, and we write
U = (1,0,0,0) . (6.59)
Therefore we only need to compute R, or equivalently R,o,. From (6.5) we have
1
RuOOo‘ = i(aoaoh;w Jr agauhoo - Z)(,Z)Ohuo - ({)Naohao) . (660)
But h,o =0, so
1
RuOOU = 58080h;w . (661)
