vectors, known as the dimension of the space. (For a tangent space associated with a point
in Minkowski space, the dimension is of course four.)

Let us imagine that at each tangent space we set up a basis of four vectors é,), with
w€{0,1,2,3} as usual. In fact let us say that each basis is adapted to the coordinates z#;
that is, the basis vector &) is what we would normally think of pointing along the z-axis,
etc. It is by no means necessary that we choose a basis which is adapted to any coordinate
system at all, although it is often convenient. (We really could be more precise here, but
later on we will repeat the discussion at an excruciating level of precision, so some sloppiness
now is forgivable.) Then any abstract vector A can be written as a linear combination of
basis vectors:

A= Ate, . (1.23)
The coefficients A* are the components of the vector A. More often than not we will forget
the basis entirely and refer somewhat loosely to “the vector A*”, but keep in mind that
this is shorthand. The real vector is an abstract geometrical entity, while the components
are just the coefficients of the basis vectors in some convenient basis. (Since we will usually
suppress the explicit basis vectors, the indices will usually label components of vectors and
tensors. This is why there are parentheses around the indices on the basis vectors, to remind
us that this is a collection of vectors, not components of a single vector.)

A standard example of a vector in spacetime is the tangent vector to a curve. A param-
eterized curve or path through spacetime is specified by the coordinates as a function of the
parameter, e.g. x*(A). The tangent vector V(A) has components

dz*
Vi =—. 1.24
Y (1.24)
The entire vector is thus V' = V*#¢(,. Under a Lorentz transformation the coordinates
a# change according to (1.11), while the parameterization A is unaltered; we can therefore
deduce that the components of the tangent vector must change as
VE S VE = AF VY (1.25)
However, the vector itself (as opposed to its components in some coordinate system) is
invariant under Lorentz transformations. We can use this fact to derive the transformation
properties of the basis vectors. Let us refer to the set of basis vectors in the transformed
coordinate system as é(,/). Since the vector is invariant, we have
V=Vt = Vl/é(lf’)
= A #Vﬂ'é(,,/) . (126)
But this relation must hold no matter what the numerical values of the components V* are.
Therefore we can say
ey =N plwry - (1.27)
