Meanwhile, for our slowly-moving particles we have 7 = 2° = t to lowest order, so the

For our wave travelling in the 2® direction, this implies that only S* and S? will be affected
— the test particles are only disturbed in directions perpendicular to the wave vector. This
is of course familiar from electromagnetism, where the electric and magnetic fields in a plane
wave are perpendicular to the wave vector.

Our wave is characterized by the two numbers, which for future convenience we will
rename as C = C; and Cx = Cpa. Let’s consider their effects separately, beginning with
the case C'y = 0. Then we have

Thus, particles initially separated in the ! direction will oscillate back and forth in the z*
direction, and likewise for those with an initial % separation. That is, if we start with a ring
of stationary particles in the x-y plane, as the wave passes they will bounce back and forth
in the shape of a “4”:
