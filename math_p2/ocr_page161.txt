In this case the circle of particles would bounce back and forth in the shape of a “x”:
y

The notation Cy and Cy should therefore be clear. These two quantities measure the two
independent modes of linear polarization of the gravitational wave. If we liked we could
consider right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes by defining

The effect of a pure Cr wave would be to rotate the particles in a right-handed sense,

and similarly for the left-handed mode C,. (Note that the individual particles do not travel
around the ring; they just move in little epicycles.)

We can relate the polarization states of classical gravitational waves to the kinds of
particles we would expect to find upon quantization. The electromagnetic field has two in-
dependent polarization states which are described by vectors in the x-y plane; equivalently,
a single polarization mode is invariant under a rotation by 360° in this plane. Upon quan-
tization this theory yields the photon, a massless spin-one particle. The neutrino, on the
other hand, is also a massless particle, described by a field which picks up a minus sign
under rotations by 360°; it is invariant under rotations of 720°, and we say it has spin—%.
