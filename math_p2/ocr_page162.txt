6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 155
The general rule is that the spin S is related to the angle § under which the polarization
modes are invariant by S = 360°/6. The gravitational field, whose waves propagate at the
speed of light, should lead to massless particles in the quantum theory. Noticing that the
polarization modes we have described are invariant under rotations of 180° in the x-y plane,
we expect the associated particles — “gravitons” — to be spin-2. We are a long way from
detecting such particles (and it would not be a surprise if we never detected them directly),
but any respectable quantum theory of gravity should predict their existence.

With plane-wave solutions to the linearized vacuum equations in our possession, it re-
mains to discuss the generation of gravitational radiation by sources. For this purpose it is
necessary to consider the equations coupled to matter,

Ohy, = —167G T}, . (6.70)
The solution to such an equation can be obtained using a Green’s function, in precisely the
same way as the analogous problem in electromagnetism. Here we will review the outline of
the method.

The Green’s function G(27 —y°) for the D’Alembertian operator O is the solution of the
wave equation in the presence of a delta-function source:

0,G(z% —y°) = 6W(a" — %) , (6.71)
where O, denotes the D’Alembertian with respect to the coordinates x7. The usefulness of
such a function resides in the fact that the general solution to an equation such as (6.70)
can be written

hu(a7) = 167G [ G(a” = y") T (y7) d'y . (6.72)
as can be verified immediately. (Notice that no factors of \/—g are necessary, since our
background is simply flat spacetime.) The solutions to (6.71) have of course been worked
out long ago, and they can be thought of as either “retarded” or “advanced,” depending on
whether they represent waves travelling forward or backward in time. Our interest is in the
retarded Green’s function, which represents the accumulated effects of signals to the past of
the point under consideration. It is given by

Ga" — y) = —————dllx— 3] — (2 — )] 6z — ) . (6.73)
' drlx — | '
Here we have used boldface to denote the spatial vectors x = (2!, 22, 2%) and y = (y',y% ¢°),
with norm [x — y| = [6;;(2" — y*) (27 — y7)]/2. The theta function 6(z° — y°) equals 1 when
2% > 40 and zero otherwise. The derivation of (6.73) would take us too far afield, but it can
be found in any standard text on electrodynamics or partial differential equations in physics.
