6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 156
Upon plugging (6.73) into (6.72), we can use the delta function to perform the integral
over y°, leaving us with
_ 1 5
hy (1, %) = 4G / ey Tl = =yl (6.74)
J |x—-y
where ¢ = 2°. The term “retarded time” is used to refer to the quantity
t.=t—|x—y|. (6.75)
The interpretation of (6.74) should be clear: the disturbance in the gravitational field at (¢, x)
is a sum of the influences from the energy and momentum sources at the point (¢,.,x —y)
on the past light cone.

Let us take this general solution and consider the case where the gravitational radiation
is emitted by an isolated source, fairly far away, comprised of nonrelativistic matter; these
approximations will be made more precise as we go on. First we need to set up some con-
ventions for Fourier transforms, which always make life easier when dealing with oscillatory
phenomena. Given a function of spacetime ¢(t,x), we are interested in its Fourier transform
(and inverse) with respect to time alone,
o(w,x) = L/dt e“to(t, x)
t,x) = —/dw e’i“’t~w,x . 6.76

Taking the transform of the metric perturbation, we obtain
