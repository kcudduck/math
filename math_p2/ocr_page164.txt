In this sequence, the first equation is simply the definition of the Fourier transform, the
second line comes from the solution (6.74), the third line is a change of variables from ¢ to
t., and the fourth line is once again the definition of the Fourier transform.

We now make the approximations that our source is isolated, far away, and slowly moving.
This means that we can consider the source to be centered at a (spatial) distance R, with
the different parts of the source at distances R 4+ 0R such that R << R. Since it is
slowly moving, most of the radiation emitted will be at frequencies w sufficiently low that
R << w!. (Essentially, light traverses the source much faster than the components of the
source itself do.)

Under these approximations, the term ¢*~¥l /|x —y| can be replaced by ¢ /R and brought
outside the integral. This leaves us with

In fact there is no need to compute all of the components of }ZLM,(OJ, x), since the harmonic

gauge condition Bufi/“”(t,x) = 0 in Fourier space implies

We therefore only need to concern ourselves with the spacelike components of lew,(w,x).
From (6.78) we therefore want to take the integral of the spacelike components of T, (w, y).
