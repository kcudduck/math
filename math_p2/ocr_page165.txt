6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 158
We begin by integrating by parts in reverse:
/dgy T (w,y) = /&c(yifkj) ddy — /yi(akfkj) dy . (6.80)
The first term is a surface integral which will vanish since the source is isolated, while the
second can be related to 7% by the Fourier-space version of 8,7 = 0:
— O T* = T . (6.81)
Thus,
/d3y Ti(w,y) = iw/yifoj &y
= Wy T dy
== / Dy T —y'y (AT™)] d*y

The second line is justified since we know that the left hand side is symmetric in ¢ and j,
while the third and fourth lines are simply repetitions of reverse integration by parts and
conservation of T"”. It is conventional to define the quadrupole moment tensor of the
energy density of the source,
ai(t) =3 [ Yy T y) dy . (6:83)
a constant tensor on each surface of constant time. In terms of the Fourier transform of the
quadrupole moment, our solution takes on the compact form

The gravitational wave produced by an isolated nonrelativistic object is therefore pro-
portional to the second derivative of the quadrupole moment of the energy density at the
