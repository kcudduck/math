6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 159
point where the past light cone of the observer intersects the source. In contrast, the leading
contribution to electromagnetic radiation comes from the changing dipole moment of the
charge density. The difference can be traced back to the universal nature of gravitation. A
changing dipole moment corresponds to motion of the center of density — charge density in
the case of electromagnetism, energy density in the case of gravitation. While there is noth-
ing to stop the center of charge of an object from oscillating, oscillation of the center of mass
of an isolated system violates conservation of momentum. (You can shake a body up and
down, but you and the earth shake ever so slightly in the opposite direction to compensate.)
The quadrupole moment, which measures the shape of the system, is generally smaller than
the dipole moment, and for this reason (as well as the weak coupling of matter to gravity)
gravitational radiation is typically much weaker than electromagnetic radiation.

It is always educational to take a general solution and apply it to a specific case of
interest. One case of genuine interest is the gravitational radiation emitted by a binary star
(two stars in orbit around each other). For simplicity let us consider two stars of mass M in
a circular orbit in the a'-2? plane, at distance r from their common center of mass.

We will treat the motion of the stars in the Newtonian approximation, where we can discuss
their orbit just as Kepler would have. Circular orbits are most easily characterized by
equating the force due to gravity to the outward “centrifugal” force:
