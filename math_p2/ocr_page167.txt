In terms of Q we can write down the explicit path of star a,
xl =rcosQt, 22 =rsinQt, (6.90)
and star b,
Ty = —rcosQt TP = —rsinQt . (6.91)
The corresponding energy density is
T, x) = M§(2?) {5(3:1 —rcosQt)S(x? — rsin Qt) + 6(z' + r cos Qt)d(2? + rsin Qt)} .

The profusion of delta functions allows us to integrate this straightforwardly to obtain the
quadrupole moment from (6.83):
qu = 6Mr*cos® Ot = 3Mr*(1 + cos 20)
g = 6Mr?sin® Qt = 3M7r*(1 — cos 2Qt)
qu2=¢qn = 6Mr*(cosQt)(sin Qt) = 3Mr?sin 20t
g3 = 0. (6.93)
From this in turn it is easy to get the components of the metric perturbation from (6.85):
—cos2Qt, —sin2Qt, 0

The remaining components of }_LW could be derived from demanding that the harmonic gauge
condition be satisfied. (We have not imposed a subsidiary gauge condition, so we are still
free to do so.)

It is natural at this point to talk about the energy emitted via gravitational radiation.
Such a discussion, however, is immediately beset by problems, both technical and philo-
sophical. As we have mentioned before, there is no true local measure of the energy in
the gravitational field. Of course, in the weak field limit, where we think of gravitation as
being described by a symmetric tensor propagating on a fixed background metric, we might
hope to derive an energy-momentum tensor for the fluctuations hy,, just as we would for
electromagnetism or any other field theory. To some extent this is possible, but there are
still difficulties. As a result of these difficulties there are a number of different proposals in
the literature for what we should use as the energy-momentum tensor for gravitation in the
