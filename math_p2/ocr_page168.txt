6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 161
weak field limit; all of them are different, but for the most part they give the same answers
for physically well-posed questions such as the rate of energy emitted by a binary system.

At a technical level, the difficulties begin to arise when we consider what form the energy-
momentum tensor should take. We have previously mentioned the energy-momentum tensors
for electromagnetism and scalar field theory, and they both shared an important feature —
they were quadratic in the relevant fields. By hypothesis our approach to the weak field limit
has been to only keep terms which are linear in the metric perturbation. Hence, in order
to keep track of the energy carried by the gravitational waves, we will have to extend our
calculations to at least second order in h,,,. In fact we have been cheating slightly all along.
In discussing the effects of gravitational waves on test particles, and the generation of waves
by a binary system, we have been using the fact that test particles move along geodesics. But
as we know, this is derived from the covariant conservation of energy-momentum, V,7*" = 0.
In the order to which we have been working, however, we actually have J,7*" = 0, which
would imply that test particles move on straight lines in the flat background metric. This
is a symptom of the fundamental inconsistency of the weak field limit. In practice, the best
that can be done is to solve the weak field equations to some appropriate order, and then
justify after the fact the validity of the solution.

Keeping these issues in mind, let us consider Einstein’s equations (in vacuum) to second
order, and see how the result can be interpreted in terms of an energy-momentum tensor for
the gravitational field. If we write the metric as g,, = 7., + hy., then at first order we have

GPm+h =0, (6.95)
where GS) is Einstein’s tensor expanded to first order in h,,. These equations determine
g, up to (unavoidable) gauge transformations, so in order to satisfy the equations at second
order we have to add a higher-order perturbation, and write

G = T + Py + 1) (6.96)
The second-order version of Einstein’s equations consists of all terms either quadratic in h,
or linear in hf) Since any cross terms would be of at least third order, we have
G +rP1+GPm+h =0. (6.97)
Here, GLZ,,) is the part of the Einstein tensor which is of second order in the metric perturba-
tion. It can be computed from the second-order Ricci tensor, which is given by
R = L070,0,h, — 170,00hu0 + (D) O + (0h0,)0
