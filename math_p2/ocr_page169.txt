6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 162
We can cast (6.97) into the suggestive form
G+ h?] = 8rGt,, (6.99)
simply by defining
1
_ _ (2)
tw = STrGG‘“’ [n+h]. (6.100)
The notation is of course meant to suggest that we think of ¢,, as an energy-momentum
tensor, specifically that of the gravitational field (at least in the weak field regime). To make
this claim seem plausible, note that the Bianchi identity for Gf,l,,) [n+ h@] implies that t 18
conserved in the flat-space sense,
Ot =0. (6.101)

Unfortunately there are some limitations on our interpretation of ¢,, as an energy-
momentum tensor. Of course it is not a tensor at all in the full theory, but we are leaving
that aside by hypothesis. More importantly, it is not invariant under gauge transformations
(infinitesimal diffeomorphisms), as you could check by direct calculation. However, we can
construct global quantities which are invariant under certain special kinds of gauge transfor-
mations (basically, those that vanish sufficiently rapidly at infinity; see Wald). These include
the total energy on a surface ¥ of constant time,

E= / too d*x (6.102)
b
and the total energy radiated through to infinity,
AE = / toun dz dt . (6.103)
s
Here, the integral is taken over a timelike surface S made of a spacelike two-sphere at infinity
and some interval in time, and n* is a unit spacelike vector normal to S.

Evaluating these formulas in terms of the quadrupole moment of a radiating source
involves a lengthy calculation which we will not reproduce here. Without further ado, the
amount of radiated energy can be written

AE = /P dt (6.104)
where the power P is given by
G [#*QU d*Q,,
pP== c Z2ul 6.105
45 { s dt®* |, 7 ( )
and here Q;; is the traceless part of the quadrupole moment,

Qij = Gij — gaijgqukl . (6.106)
