1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 10
To get the new basis &, in terms of the old one é,) we should multiply by the inverse
of the Lorentz transformation A”' u- But the inverse of a Lorentz transformation from the
unprimed to the primed coordinates is also a Lorentz transformation, this time from the
primed to the unprimed systems. We will therefore introduce a somewhat subtle notation,
by writing using the same symbol for both matrices, just with primed and unprimed indices
adjusted. That is,

(A™HY = A" (1.28)
or

AN =60 AN, =6k (1.29)

where 84 is the traditional Kronecker delta symbol in four dimensions. (Note that Schutz uses
a different convention, always arranging the two indices northwest/southeast; the important
thing is where the primes go.) From (1.27) we then obtain the transformation rule for basis
vectors:

ewy =AM e (1.30)
Therefore the set of basis vectors transforms via the inverse Lorentz transformation of the
coordinates or vector components.

It is worth pausing a moment to take all this in. We introduced coordinates labeled by
upper indices, which transformed in a certain way under Lorentz transformations. We then
considered vector components which also were written with upper indices, which made sense
since they transformed in the same way as the coordinate functions. (In a fixed coordinate
system, each of the four coordinates z# can be thought of as a function on spacetime, as
can each of the four components of a vector field.) The basis vectors associated with the
coordinate system transformed via the inverse matrix, and were labeled by a lower index.
This notation ensured that the invariant object constructed by summing over the components
and basis vectors was left unchanged by the transformation, just as we would wish. It’s
probably not giving too much away to say that this will continue to be the case for more
complicated objects with multiple indices (tensors).

Once we have set up a vector space, there is an associated vector space (of equal dimen-
sion) which we can immediately define, known as the dual vector space. The dual space
is usually denoted by an asterisk, so that the dual space to the tangent space T, is called
the cotangent space and denoted 7;;. The dual space is the space of all linear maps from
the original vector space to the real numbers; in math lingo, if w € 7} is a dual vector, then
it acts as a map such that:

w(@V +bW) = aw(V) + bw(W) € R, (1.31)
where V| W are vectors and a, b are real numbers. The nice thing about these maps is that
they form a vector space themselves; thus, if w and 7 are dual vectors, we have

(aw +bn)(V) = aw(V) + bn(V) . (1.32)
