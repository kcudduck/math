6 WEAK FIELDS AND GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION 163
For the binary system represented by (6.93), the traceless part of the quadrupole is
(14 3 cos2Qt) 3sin 20 0
Qij = Mr? 3sin 202 (1—3cos2Qt) 0 , (6.107)
0 0 -2
and its third time derivative is therefore
BQ; sin2Qt  —cos2Qt 0
— = 24MP2QP | —cos2Q  —sin20t 0 | . (6.108)

The power radiated by the binary is thus

or, using expression (6.89) for the frequency,
2 GAMP

Of course, this has actually been observed. In 1974 Hulse and Taylor discovered a binary
system, PSR1913+16, in which both stars are very small (so classical effects are negligible, or
at least under control) and one is a pulsar. The period of the orbit is eight hours, extremely
small by astrophysical standards. The fact that one of the stars is a pulsar provides a very
accurate clock, with respect to which the change in the period as the system loses energy
can be measured. The result is consistent with the prediction of general relativity for energy
loss through gravitational radiation. Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993
for their efforts.
