7 The Schwarzschild Solution and Black Holes

We now move from the domain of the weak-field limit to solutions of the full nonlinear
Einstein’s equations. With the possible exception of Minkowski space, by far the most
important such solution is that discovered by Schwarzschild, which describes spherically
symmetric vacuum spacetimes. Since we are in vacuum, Einstein’s equations become R, =
0. Of course, if we have a proposed solution to a set of differential equations such as this,
it would suffice to plug in the proposed solution in order to verify it; we would like to do
better, however. In fact, we will sketch a proof of Birkhoff’s theorem, which states that the
Schwarzschild solution is the unique spherically symmetric solution to Einstein’s equations
in vacuum. The procedure will be to first present some non-rigorous arguments that any
spherically symmetric metric (whether or not it solves Einstein’s equations) must take on a
certain form, and then work from there to more carefully derive the actual solution in such
a case.

“Spherically symmetric” means “having the same symmetries as a sphere.” (In this
section the word “sphere” means S2, not spheres of higher dimension.) Since the object of
interest to us is the metric on a differentiable manifold, we are concerned with those metrics
that have such symmetries. We know how to characterize symmetries of the metric — they
are given by the existence of Killing vectors. Furthermore, we know what the Killing vectors
of S? are, and that there are three of them. Therefore, a spherically symmetric manifold
is one that has three Killing vector fields which are just like those on S2. By “just like”
we mean that the commutator of the Killing vectors is the same in either case — in fancier
language, that the algebra generated by the vectors is the same. Something that we didn’t
show, but is true, is that we can choose our three Killing vectors on S to be (V1) V2 1/3))
such that

[V(l), V(2)] = 7@

[V<2), V<3)] = vy

Ve vy = vOo, (7.1)
The commutation relations are exactly those of SO(3), the group of rotations in three di-
mensions. This is no coincidence, of course, but we won’t pursue this here. All we need is
that a spherically symmetric manifold is one which possesses three Killing vector fields with
the above commutation relations.

Back in section three we mentioned Frobenius’s Theorem, which states that if you have
a set of commuting vector fields then there exists a set of coordinate functions such that the
vector fields are the partial derivatives with respect to these functions. In fact the theorem
