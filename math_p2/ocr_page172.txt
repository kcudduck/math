7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 165
does not stop there, but goes on to say that if we have some vector fields which do not
commute, but whose commutator closes — the commutator of any two fields in the set is a
linear combination of other fields in the set — then the integral curves of these vector fields
“fit together” to describe submanifolds of the manifold on which they are all defined. The
dimensionality of the submanifold may be smaller than the number of vectors, or it could be
equal, but obviously not larger. Vector fields which obey (7.1) will of course form 2-spheres.
Since the vector fields stretch throughout the space, every point will be on exactly one of
these spheres. (Actually, it’s almost every point — we will show below how it can fail to be
absolutely every point.) Thus, we say that a spherically symmetric manifold can be foliated
into spheres.

Let’s consider some examples to bring this down to earth. The simplest example is
flat three-dimensional Euclidean space. If we pick an origin, then R? is clearly spherically
symmetric with respect to rotations around this origin. Under such rotations (i.e., under
the flow of the Killing vector fields) points move into each other, but each point stays on an
S? at a fixed distance from the origin.

It is these spheres which foliate R?. Of course, they don’t really foliate all of the space, since
the origin itself just stays put under rotations — it doesn’t move around on some two-sphere.
But it should be clear that almost all of the space is properly foliated, and this will turn out
to be enough for us.

We can also have spherical symmetry without an “origin” to rotate things around. An
example is provided by a “wormhole”, with topology R x S2. If we suppress a dimension
and draw our two-spheres as circles, such a space might look like this:
