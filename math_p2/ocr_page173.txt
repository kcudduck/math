In this case the entire manifold can be foliated by two-spheres.

This foliated structure suggests that we put coordinates on our manifold in a way which
is adapted to the foliation. By this we mean that, if we have an n-dimensional manifold
foliated by m-dimensional submanifolds, we can use a set of m coordinate functions u' on
the submanifolds and a set of n —m coordinate functions v! to tell us which submanifold we
are on. (So 4 runs from 1 to m, while I runs from 1 to n —m.) Then the collection of v’s
and u’s coordinatize the entire space. If the submanifolds are maximally symmetric spaces
(as two-spheres are), then there is the following powerful theorem: it is always possible to
choose the u-coordinates such that the metric on the entire manifold is of the form

ds? = g datde” = grs(v)dv'de” + f(v)y(u)duide . (7.2)
Here ~;;(u) is the metric on the submanifold. This theorem is saying two things at once:
that there are no cross terms dv!du/, and that both gr;(v) and f(v) are functions of the
v! alone, independent of the u’. Proving the theorem is a mess, but you are encouraged
to look in chapter 13 of Weinberg. Nevertheless, it is a perfectly sensible result. Roughly
speaking, if g;; or f depended on the u’ then the metric would change as we moved in a
single submanifold, which violates the assumption of symmetry. The unwanted cross terms,
meanwhile, can be eliminated by making sure that the tangent vectors d/dv! are orthogonal
to the submanifolds — in other words, that we line up our submanifolds in the same way
throughout the space.

We are now through with handwaving, and can commence some honest calculation. For
the case at hand, our submanifolds are two-spheres, on which we typically choose coordinates
(0, ¢) in which the metric takes the form

dQ? = d6* +sin? 0 do® . (7.3)
Since we are interested in a four-dimensional spacetime, we need two more coordinates, which
we can call @ and b. The theorem (7.2) is then telling us that the metric on a spherically
