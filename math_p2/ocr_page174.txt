7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 167
symmetric spacetime can be put in the form
ds? = gaa(a,b)da® + gap(a, b)(dadb + dbda) + gy(a, b)db? + r?(a, b)dQ? . (7.4)
Here r(a, b) is some as-yet-undetermined function, to which we have merely given a suggestive
label. There is nothing to stop us, however, from changing coordinates from (a,b) to (a,r),
by inverting r(a,b). (The one thing that could possibly stop us would be if r were a function
of a alone; in this case we could just as easily switch to (b,7), so we will not consider this
situation separately.) The metric is then
ds® = gaala,7)da® + gor(a,7)(dadr + drda) + g, (a,7)dr? + r2dQ? . (7.5)
Our next step is to find a function ¢(a,r) such that, in the (¢,7) coordinate system, there
are no cross terms dtdr + drdt in the metric. Notice that

We would like to replace the first three terms in the metric (7.5) by
mdt? + ndr? (7.8)
for some functions m and n. This is equivalent to the requirements

(5e) (35) = e
We therefore have three equations for the three unknowns ¢(a,r), m(a,r), and n(a,r), just
enough to determine them precisely (up to initial conditions for ¢). (Of course, they are
“determined” in terms of the unknown functions g,, gar, and g, so in this sense they are
still undetermined.) We can therefore put our metric in the form
ds® = m(t,r)dt* + n(t,r)dr? + r?dQ* . (7.12)
