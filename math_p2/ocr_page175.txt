7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 168
To this point the only difference between the two coordinates ¢ and r is that we have
chosen r to be the one which multiplies the metric for the two-sphere. This choice was
motivated by what we know about the metric for flat Minkowski space, which can be written
ds? = —dt? + dr? + r2dQ?. We know that the spacetime under consideration is Lorentzian,
so either m or n will have to be negative. Let us choose m, the coefficient of dt?, to be
negative. This is not a choice we are simply allowed to make, and in fact we will see later
that it can go wrong, but we will assume it for now. The assumption is not completely
unreasonable, since we know that Minkowski space is itself spherically symmetric, and will
therefore be described by (7.12). With this choice we can trade in the functions m and n for
new functions « and [, such that
ds® = —e*t g2 4 2000 qr? 4 12402 (7.13)
This is the best we can do for a general metric in a spherically symmetric spacetime. The
next step is to actually solve Einstein’s equations, which will allow us to determine explicitly
the functions a(t,r) and G(¢,r). It is unfortunately necessary to compute the Christoffel
symbols for (7.13), from which we can get the curvature tensor and thus the Ricci tensor. If
we use labels (0,1,2,3) for (¢,7,6,¢) in the usual way, the Christoffel symbols are given by
'Yy = Gocx Iy, = 1Y, = 2P~ 99,8
T = 29 I =00 =08
[ =1 [y = —re Il =1
Tl = —resin?0 T3, = —sinfcos® T =0 (7.14)
(Anything not written down explicitly is meant to be zero, or related to what is written
by symmetries.) From these we get the following nonvanishing components of the Riemann
tensor:
RO = e 3EB + (008) — 0oadofB] + (01018 — OFa — (1)’
Rl = —re 29
R = —re?Psin®0 i
Rl = —re ™9y
Rl33 = —re *sin®6 0,0
Ry = re 013
Rlys = re ?sin0 0,0
Ry = (1—e P)sin’0 . (7.15)
Taking the contraction as usual yields the Ricci tensor:
Ry = [028+ (30fB)? — 00adoB] + 2 P[2a + (1) — D1ad 3 + %0101]
