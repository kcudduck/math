Ry = e’zg[r(alﬂ —O0i) — 1] +1
Our job is to set R, = 0. From Ry = 0 we get
QB =0. (7.17)
If we consider taking the time derivative of Ry = 0 and using 9y = 0, we get
o1 =0 . (7.18)
We can therefore write
g = B(r)
a = f(r)+g(). (7.19)
The first term in the metric (7.13) is therefore —e*e2®dt2. But we could always simply
redefine our time coordinate by replacing dt — e~9®)d¢; in other words, we are free to choose
t such that g(t) = 0, whence «a(t,r) = f(r). We therefore have
ds?* = =M 4 P0dr? 4 r2dQ? (7.20)
All of the metric components are independent of the coordinate t. We have therefore proven
a crucial result: any spherically symmetric vacuum metric possesses a timelike Killing vector.
This property is so interesting that it gets its own name: a metric which possesses a
timelike Killing vector is called stationary. There is also a more restrictive property: a
metric is called static if it possesses a timelike Killing vector which is orthogonal to a
family of hypersurfaces. (A hypersurface in an n-dimensional manifold is simply an (n — 1)-
dimensional submanifold.) The metric (7.20) is not only stationary, but also static; the
Killing vector field 9 is orthogonal to the surfaces t = const (since there are no cross terms
such as dtdr and so on). Roughly speaking, a static metric is one in which nothing is moving,
while a stationary metric allows things to move but only in a symmetric way. For example,
the static spherically symmetric metric (7.20) will describe non-rotating stars or black holes,
while rotating systems (which keep rotating in the same way at all times) will be described
by stationary metrics. It’s hard to remember which word goes with which concept, but the
distinction between the two concepts should be understandable.
Let’s keep going with finding the solution. Since both Ry and Rj; vanish, we can write
