which implies &« = —3 + constant. Once again, we can get rid of the constant by scaling
our coordinates, so we have
a=—03. (7.22)
Next let us turn to Ry = 0, which now reads
e (2rdia+1)=1. (7.23)
This is completely equivalent to
o(re*) =1. (7.24)
We can solve this to obtain
=1+ 5 (7.25)

where p is some undetermined constant. With (7.22) and (7.25), our metric becomes

We now have no freedom left except for the single constant u, so this form better solve the
remaining equations Ry = 0 and Ry; = 0; it is straightforward to check that it does, for any
value of p.

The only thing left to do is to interpret the constant y in terms of some physical param-
eter. The most important use of a spherically symmetric vacuum solution is to represent the
spacetime outside a star or planet or whatnot. In that case we would expect to recover the
weak field limit as r — oco. In this limit, (7.26) implies

The weak field limit, on the other hand, has
go = —(1+2®),
with the potential ® = —GM/r. Therefore the metrics do agree in this limit, if we set
= —2GM.
Our final result is the celebrated Schwarzschild metric,

This is true for any spherically symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein’s equations; M func-
tions as a parameter, which we happen to know can be interpreted as the conventional
