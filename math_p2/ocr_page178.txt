7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 171
Newtonian mass that we would measure by studying orbits at large distances from the grav-
itating source. Note that as M — 0 we recover Minkowski space, which is to be expected.
Note also that the metric becomes progressively Minkowskian as we go to r — oo; this
property is known as asymptotic flatness.

The fact that the Schwarzschild metric is not just a good solution, but is the unique
spherically symmetric vacuum solution, is known as Birkhoff’s theorem. It is interesting to
note that the result is a static metric. We did not say anything about the source except that
it be spherically symmetric. Specifically, we did not demand that the source itself be static;
it could be a collapsing star, as long as the collapse were symmetric. Therefore a process
such as a supernova explosion, which is basically spherical, would be expected to generate
very little gravitational radiation (in comparison to the amount of energy released through
other channels). This is the same result we would have obtained in electromagnetism, where
the electromagnetic fields around a spherical charge distribution do not depend on the radial
distribution of the charges.

Before exploring the behavior of test particles in the Schwarzschild geometry, we should
say something about singularities. From the form of (7.29), the metric coefficients become
infinite at » = 0 and r = 2GM — an apparent sign that something is going wrong. The
metric coefficients, of course, are coordinate-dependent quantities, and as such we should
not make too much of their values; it is certainly possible to have a “coordinate singularity”
which results from a breakdown of a specific coordinate system rather than the underlying
manifold. An example occurs at the origin of polar coordinates in the plane, where the
metric ds? = dr? + r2d6? becomes degenerate and the component g% = r~2 of the inverse
metric blows up, even though that point of the manifold is no different from any other.

What kind of coordinate-independent signal should we look for as a warning that some-
thing about the geometry is out of control? This turns out to be a difficult question to
answer, and entire books have been written about the nature of singularities in general rel-
ativity. We won’t go into this issue in detail, but rather turn to one simple criterion for
when something has gone wrong — when the curvature becomes infinite. The curvature is
measured by the Riemann tensor, and it is hard to say when a tensor becomes infinite, since
its components are coordinate-dependent. But from the curvature we can construct various
scalar quantities, and since scalars are coordinate-independent it will be meaningful to say
that they become infinite. This simplest such scalar is the Ricci scalar R = g"”R,,,, but we
can also construct higher-order scalars such as R R, R*"" R, 0, RWWR"”“R,\T“”, and
so on. If any of these scalars (not necessarily all of them) go to infinity as we approach some
point, we will regard that point as a singularity of the curvature. We should also check that
the point is not “infinitely far away”; that is, that it can be reached by travelling a finite
distance along a curve.

We therefore have a sufficient condition for a point to be considered a singularity. It is
