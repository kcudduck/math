7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 172
not a necessary condition, however, and it is generally harder to show that a given point is
nonsingular; for our purposes we will simply test to see if geodesics are well-behaved at the
point in question, and if so then we will consider the point nonsingular. In the case of the
Schwarzschild metric (7.29), direct calculation reveals that

This is enough to convince us that » = 0 represents an honest singularity. At the other
trouble spot, r = 2GM, you could check and see that none of the curvature invariants blows
up. We therefore begin to think that it is actually not singular, and we have simply chosen a
bad coordinate system. The best thing to do is to transform to more appropriate coordinates
if possible. We will soon see that in this case it is in fact possible, and the surface r = 2GM
is very well-behaved (although interesting) in the Schwarzschild metric.

Having worried a little about singularities, we should point out that the behavior of
Schwarzschild at » < 2GM is of little day-to-day consequence. The solution we derived
is valid only in vacuum, and we expect it to hold outside a spherical body such as a star.
However, in the case of the Sun we are dealing with a body which extends to a radius of

R, = 10°GM,, . (7.31)
Thus, r = 2GM,, is far inside the solar interior, where we do not expect the Schwarzschild
metric to imply. In fact, realistic stellar interior solutions are of the form

See Schutz for details. Here m(r) is a function of r which goes to zero faster than r itself, so
there are no singularities to deal with at all. Nevertheless, there are objects for which the full
Schwarzschild metric is required — black holes — and therefore we will let our imaginations
roam far outside the solar system in this section.

The first step we will take to understand this metric more fully is to consider the behavior

of geodesics. We need the nonzero Christoffel symbols for Schwarzschild:
Ty = S (r — 2GM) I} = 1(7*27&11”) g, = 1(7*27%1”)
r3 =1 Il =—(r—2GM) ;=1
Tl =—(r—2GM)sin®0 T3 =—sinfcosf  TI3y=<0. (7.33)
The geodesic equation therefore turns into the following four equations, where \ is an affine
parameter:
