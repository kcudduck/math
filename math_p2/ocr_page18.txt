1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 11
To make this construction somewhat more concrete, we can introduce a set of basis dual
vectors #*) by demanding

0¥ (e()) = 3. (1.33)
Then every dual vector can be written in terms of its components, which we label with lower
indices:

w=w,H" . (1.34)

In perfect analogy with vectors, we will usually simply write w, to stand for the entire dual
vector. In fact, you will sometime see elements of T), (what we have called vectors) referred to
as contravariant vectors, and elements of T, (what we have called dual vectors) referred
to as covariant vectors. Actually, if you just refer to ordinary vectors as vectors with upper
indices and dual vectors as vectors with lower indices, nobody should be offended. Another
name for dual vectors is one-forms, a somewhat mysterious designation which will become
clearer soon.

The component notation leads to a simple way of writing the action of a dual vector on
a vector:

wV) = w, V0¥ (e,)
= w, V"
= w,V"eR. (1.35)
This is why it is rarely necessary to write the basis vectors (and dual vectors) explicitly; the
components do all of the work. The form of (1.35) also suggests that we can think of vectors
as linear maps on dual vectors, by defining
Viw)=w(V)=w,V". (1.36)
Therefore, the dual space to the dual vector space is the original vector space itself.

Of course in spacetime we will be interested not in a single vector space, but in fields of
vectors and dual vectors. (The set of all cotangent spaces over M is the cotangent bundle,
T*(M).) In that case the action of a dual vector field on a vector field is not a single number,
but a scalar (or just “function”) on spacetime. A scalar is a quantity without indices, which
is unchanged under Lorentz transformations.

We can use the same arguments that we earlier used for vectors to derive the transfor-
mation properties of dual vectors. The answers are, for the components,

wy =Ny w, (1.37)
and for basis dual vectors,
G = A”' 00 . (1.38)
