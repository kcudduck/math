There does not seem to be much hope for simply solving this set of coupled equations by
inspection. Fortunately our task is greatly simplified by the high degree of symmetry of the
Schwarzschild metric. We know that there are four Killing vectors: three for the spherical
symmetry, and one for time translations. Each of these will lead to a constant of the motion
for a free particle; if K* is a Killing vector, we know that
K,‘,% = constant . (7.38)
In addition, there is another constant of the motion that we always have for geodesics; metric
compatibility implies that along the path the quantity
dxt dx”
€= _guuﬁﬁ (7.39)
is constant. Of course, for a massive particle we typically choose A = 7, and this relation
simply becomes € = —g,, U*U” = +1. For a massless particle we always have ¢ = 0. We will
also be concerned with spacelike geodesics (even though they do not correspond to paths of
particles), for which we will choose ¢ = —1.

Rather than immediately writing out explicit expressions for the four conserved quantities
associated with Killing vectors, let’s think about what they are telling us. Notice that the
symmetries they represent are also present in flat spacetime, where the conserved quantities
they lead to are very familiar. Invariance under time translations leads to conservation of
energy, while invariance under spatial rotations leads to conservation of the three components
of angular momentum. Essentially the same applies to the Schwarzschild metric. We can
think of the angular momentum as a three-vector with a magnitude (one component) and
direction (two components). Conservation of the direction of angular momentum means
that the particle will move in a plane. We can choose this to be the equatorial plane of
our coordinate system; if the particle is not in this plane, we can rotate coordinates until
it is. Thus, the two Killing vectors which lead to conservation of the direction of angular
momentum imply

0= g . (7.40)
