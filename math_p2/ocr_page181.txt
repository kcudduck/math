7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 174
The two remaining Killing vectors correspond to energy and the magnitude of angular mo-
mentum. The energy arises from the timelike Killing vector K = 9y, or
2GM
K, = <7 (1 - 7—) ,0,0,0) . (7.41)
The Killing vector whose conserved quantity is the magnitude of the angular momentum is
L = 0y, or
L, = (o,o,o,ﬂsm2 9) . (7.42)
Since (7.40) implies that sinf = 1 along the geodesics of interest to us, the two conserved
quantities are

[y (7.44)
For massless particles these can be thought of as the energy and angular momentum; for
massive particles they are the energy and angular momentum per unit mass of the particle.
Note that the constancy of (7.44) is the GR equivalent of Kepler’s second law (equal areas
are swept out in equal times).

Together these conserved quantities provide a convenient way to understand the orbits of
particles in the Schwarzschild geometry. Let us expand the expression (7.39) for € to obtain
2GM Y [ dt? 2GM\ ' (dr)? g\’

If we multiply this by (1 — 2GM/r) and use our expressions for £ and L, we obtain

This is certainly progress, since we have taken a messy system of coupled equations and
obtained a single equation for r(\). It looks even nicer if we rewrite it as

In (7.47) we have precisely the equation for a classical particle of unit mass and “energy”
%Ez moving in a one-dimensional potential given by V(r). (The true energy per unit mass
is E, but the effective potential for the coordinate r responds to %EQ)
