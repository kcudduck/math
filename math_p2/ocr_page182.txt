7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 175

Of course, our physical situation is quite different from a classical particle moving in one
dimension. The trajectories under consideration are orbits around a star or other object:

S
The quantities of interest to us are not only (), but also ¢(\) and ¢(\). Nevertheless,
we can go a long way toward understanding all of the orbits by understanding their radial
behavior, and it is a great help to reduce this behavior to a problem we know how to solve.

A similar analysis of orbits in Newtonian gravity would have produced a similar result;
the general equation (7.47) would have been the same, but the effective potential (7.48) would
not have had the last term. (Note that this equation is not a power series in 1/r, it is exact.)
In the potential (7.48) the first term is just a constant, the second term corresponds exactly
to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and the third term is a contribution from angular
momentum which takes the same form in Newtonian gravity and general relativity. The last
term, the GR contribution, will turn out to make a great deal of difference, especially at
small r.

Let us examine the kinds of possible orbits, as illustrated in the figures. There are
different curves V/(r) for different values of L; for any one of these curves, the behavior of
the orbit can be judged by comparing the %EQ to V(r). The general behavior of the particle
will be to move in the potential until it reaches a “turning point” where V(r) = %Ez, where
it will begin moving in the other direction. Sometimes there may be no turning point to
hit, in which case the particle just keeps going. In other cases the particle may simply move
in a circular orbit at radius r. = const; this can happen if the potential is flat, dV/dr = 0.
Differentiating (7.48), we find that the circular orbits occur when

eGMr? — L*r, +3GML*y =0 , (7.49)
where 7 = 0 in Newtonian gravity and v = 1 in general relativity. Circular orbits will be
stable if they correspond to a minimum of the potential, and unstable if they correspond
to a maximum. Bound orbits which are not circular will oscillate around the radius of the
stable circular orbit.

Turning to Newtonian gravity, we find that circular orbits appear at
