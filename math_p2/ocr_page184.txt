7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 177
For massless particles ¢ = 0, and there are no circular orbits; this is consistent with the
figure, which illustrates that there are no bound orbits of any sort. Although it is somewhat
obscured in this coordinate system, massless particles actually move in a straight line, since
the Newtonian gravitational force on a massless particle is zero. (Of course the standing of
massless particles in Newtonian theory is somewhat problematic, but we will ignore that for
now.) In terms of the effective potential, a photon with a given energy £ will come in from
r = oo and gradually “slow down” (actually dr/d\ will decrease, but the speed of light isn’t
changing) until it reaches the turning point, when it will start moving away back to r = oo.
The lower values of L, for which the photon will come closer before it starts moving away,
are simply those trajectories which are initially aimed closer to the gravitating body. For
massive particles there will be stable circular orbits at the radius (7.50), as well as bound
orbits which oscillate around this radius. If the energy is greater than the asymptotic value
E =1, the orbits will be unbound, describing a particle that approaches the star and then
recedes. We know that the orbits in Newton’s theory are conic sections — bound orbits are
either circles or ellipses, while unbound ones are either parabolas or hyperbolas — although
we won't show that here.

In general relativity the situation is different, but only for r sufficiently small. Since the
difference resides in the term —GML?/r®, as r — oo the behaviors are identical in the two
theories. But as r — 0 the potential goes to —oo rather than +o0o as in the Newtonian
case. At r = 2GM the potential is always zero; inside this radius is the black hole, which we
will discuss more thoroughly later. For massless particles there is always a barrier (except
for L = 0, for which the potential vanishes identically), but a sufficiently energetic photon
will nevertheless go over the barrier and be dragged inexorably down to the center. (Note
that “sufficiently energetic” means “in comparison to its angular momentum” — in fact the
frequency of the photon is immaterial, only the direction in which it is pointing.) At the top
of the barrier there are unstable circular orbits. For e = 0, v = 1, we can easily solve (7.49)
to obtain

re=3GM . (7.51)
This is borne out by the figure, which shows a maximum of V(r) at r = 3GM for every L.
This means that a photon can orbit forever in a circle at this radius, but any perturbation
will cause it to fly away either to r =0 or r = oco.

For massive particles there are once again different regimes depending on the angular
momentum. The circular orbits are at

rp = L2+ VI - 12 ) (7.52)
2GM
For large L there will be two circular orbits, one stable and one unstable. In the L — oo
