In this limit the stable circular orbit becomes farther and farther away, while the unstable
one approaches 3GM, behavior which parallels the massless case. As we decrease L the two
circular orbits come closer together; they coincide when the discriminant in (7.52) vanishes,
at
L=V12GM , (7.54)

and disappear entirely for smaller L. Thus 6GM is the smallest possible radius of a stable
circular orbit in the Schwarzschild metric. There are also unbound orbits, which come in
from infinity and turn around, and bound but noncircular ones, which oscillate around the
stable circular radius. Note that such orbits, which would describe exact conic sections in
Newtonian gravity, will not do so in GR, although we would have to solve the equation for
dg¢/dt to demonstrate it. Finally, there are orbits which come in from infinity and continue
all the way in to r = 0; this can happen either if the energy is higher than the barrier, or for
L < v/12GM, when the barrier goes away entirely.

We have therefore found that the Schwarzschild solution possesses stable circular orbits
for r > 6G M and unstable circular orbits for 3GM < r < 6GM. It’s important to remember
that these are only the geodesics; there is nothing to stop an accelerating particle from
dipping below r = 3GM and emerging, as long as it stays beyond r = 2GM.

Most experimental tests of general relativity involve the motion of test particles in the
solar system, and hence geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric; this is therefore a good place
to pause and consider these tests. Einstein suggested three tests: the deflection of light,
the precession of perihelia, and gravitational redshift. The deflection of light is observable
in the weak-field limit, and therefore is not really a good test of the exact form of the
Schwarzschild geometry. Observations of this deflection have been performed during eclipses
of the Sun, with results which agree with the GR prediction (although it’s not an especially
clean experiment). The precession of perihelia reflects the fact that noncircular orbits are
not closed ellipses; to a good approximation they are ellipses which precess, describing a
flower pattern.

Using our geodesic equations, we could solve for d¢/d\ as a power series in the eccentricity
e of the orbit, and from that obtain the apsidal frequency w,, defined as 27 divided by the
time it takes for the ellipse to precess once around. For details you can look in Weinberg;
