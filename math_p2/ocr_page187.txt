7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 180
where we have restored the ¢ to make it easier to compare with observation. (It is a good
exercise to derive this yourself to lowest nonvanishing order, in which case the e? is missing.)
Historically the precession of Mercury was the first test of GR. For Mercury the relevant
numbers are

G M, -

=2 = 148x10° em

c
a = 555x 102 cm, (7.57)

and of course ¢ = 3.00 x 10 cm/sec. This gives w, = 2.35 x 107 sec™!. In other words,
the major axis of Mercury’s orbit precesses at a rate of 42.9 arcsecs every 100 years. The
observed value is 5601 arcsecs/100 yrs. However, much of that is due to the precession
of equinoxes in our geocentric coordinate system; 5025 arcsecs/100 yrs, to be precise. The
gravitational perturbations of the other planets contribute an additional 532 arcsecs/100 yrs,
leaving 43 arcsecs/100 yrs to be explained by GR, which it does quite well.

The gravitational redshift, as we have seen, is another effect which is present in the weak
field limit, and in fact will be predicted by any theory of gravity which obeys the Principle
of Equivalence. However, this only applies to small enough regions of spacetime; over larger
distances, the exact amount of redshift will depend on the metric, and thus on the theory
under question. It is therefore worth computing the redshift in the Schwarzschild geometry.
We consider two observers who are not moving on geodesics, but are stuck at fixed spatial
coordinate values (71, 61, ¢1) and (12, 0, ¢2). According to (7.45), the proper time of observer
¢ will be related to the coordinate time t by

dr; 2GMN\Y?

Suppose that the observer O; emits a light pulse which travels to the observer Oy, such that
O; measures the time between two successive crests of the light wave to be A7y, Each crest
follows the same path to O,, except that they are separated by a coordinate time
