7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 181
This separation in coordinate time does not change along the photon trajectories, but the
second observer measures a time between successive crests given by
1/2
Ar = (1—M>/ At

Since these intervals A7; measure the proper time between two crests of an electromagnetic
wave, the observed frequencies will be related by
wWa o ATI

This is an exact result for the frequency shift; in the limit » >> 2GM we have
Wo GM GM

This tells us that the frequency goes down as ® increases, which happens as we climb out
of a gravitational field; thus, a redshift. You can check that it agrees with our previous
calculation based on the equivalence principle.

Since Einstein’s proposal of the three classic tests, further tests of GR have been proposed.
The most famous is of course the binary pulsar, discussed in the previous section. Another
is the gravitational time delay, discovered by (and observed by) Shapiro. This is just the
fact that the time elapsed along two different trajectories between two events need not be
the same. It has been measured by reflecting radar signals off of Venus and Mars, and once
again is consistent with the GR prediction. One effect which has not yet been observed is
the Lense-Thirring, or frame-dragging effect. There has been a long-term effort devoted to
a proposed satellite, dubbed Gravity Probe B, which would involve extraordinarily precise
gyroscopes whose precession could be measured and the contribution from GR sorted out. It
has a ways to go before being launched, however, and the survival of such projects is always
year-to-year.

We now know something about the behavior of geodesics outside the troublesome radius
r = 2GM, which is the regime of interest for the solar system and most other astrophysical
situations. We will next turn to the study of objects which are described by the Schwarzschild
solution even at radii smaller than 2GM — black holes. (We’ll use the term “black hole”
for the moment, even though we haven’t introduced a precise meaning for such an object.)
