7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 182
One way of understanding a geometry is to explore its causal structure, as defined by the
light cones. We therefore consider radial null curves, those for which 6 and ¢ are constant
and ds? = 0: »
ds? =0=— (1 - ﬂ) dt* + <1 - @) dr? | (7.63)
from which we see that i T
s (1 - T) . (7.64)
This of course measures the slope of the light cones on a spacetime diagram of the ¢-r plane.
For large r the slope is £1, as it would be in flat space, while as we approach r = 2GM we
get dt/dr — +oo, and the light cones “close up”:
t |
~l7 r
2GM
Thus a light ray which approaches r = 2GM never seems to get there, at least in this
coordinate system; instead it seems to asymptote to this radius.

As we will see, this is an illusion, and the light ray (or a massive particle) actually has no
trouble reaching » = 2G M. But an observer far away would never be able to tell. If we stayed
outside while an intrepid observational general relativist dove into the black hole, sending
back signals all the time, we would simply see the signals reach us more and more slowly. This
should be clear from the pictures, and is confirmed by our computation of Ar; /A7, when we
discussed the gravitational redshift (7.61). As infalling astronauts approach r = 2GM, any
fixed interval A7y of their proper time corresponds to a longer and longer interval A7, from
our point of view. This continues forever; we would never see the astronaut cross r = 2GM,
we would just see them move more and more slowly (and become redder and redder, almost
as if they were embarrassed to have done something as stupid as diving into a black hole).

The fact that we never see the infalling astronauts reach r = 2GM is a meaningful
statement, but the fact that their trajectory in the ¢-r plane never reaches there is not. It
is highly dependent on our coordinate system, and we would like to ask a more coordinate-
independent question (such as, do the astronauts reach this radius in a finite amount of their
proper time?). The best way to do this is to change coordinates to a system which is better
