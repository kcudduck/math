1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 12
This is just what we would expect from index placement; the components of a dual vector
transform under the inverse transformation of those of a vector. Note that this ensures that
the scalar (1.35) is invariant under Lorentz transformations, just as it should be.

Let’s consider some examples of dual vectors, first in other contexts and then in Minkowski
space. Imagine the space of n-component column vectors, for some integer n. Then the dual
space is that of n-component row vectors, and the action is ordinary matrix multiplication:

Vl
V2
vV = L w=(wwy e owy)
V’Il
Vl
V2
wlV) = Ww - wn)| [ =wV'. (1.39)
V’Il
Another familiar example occurs in quantum mechanics, where vectors in the Hilbert space
are represented by kets, [¢). In this case the dual space is the space of bras, (¢|, and the
action gives the number (¢[y). (This is a complex number in quantum mechanics, but the
idea is precisely the same.)

In spacetime the simplest example of a dual vector is the gradient of a scalar function,

the set of partial derivatives with respect to the spacetime coordinates, which we denote by
dp = —0w . 1.40
P = o (1.40)
The conventional chain rule used to transform partial derivatives amounts in this case to the
transformation rule of components of dual vectors:
do  0z" I¢
ozt Ox Ozt
99
A, P (1.41)
where we have used (1.11) and (1.28) to relate the Lorentz transformation to the coordinates.
The fact that the gradient is a dual vector leads to the following shorthand notations for
partial derivatives:
99 _ .
T = =00 (1.42)
