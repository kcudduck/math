behaved at r = 2GM. There does exist a set of such coordinates, which we now set out to
find. There is no way to “derive” a coordinate transformation, of course, we just say what
the new coordinates are and plug in the formulas. But we will develop these coordinates in
several steps, in hopes of making the choices seem somewhat motivated.

The problem with our current coordinates is that dt/dr — oo along radial null geodesics
which approach r = 2G'M; progress in the r direction becomes slower and slower with respect
to the coordinate time ¢. We can try to fix this problem by replacing ¢ with a coordinate
which “moves more slowly” along null geodesics. First notice that we can explicitly solve
the condition (7.64) characterizing radial null curves to obtain

t = 41"+ constant , (7.65)
where the tortoise coordinate r* is defined by
r
=1+ 2GM1 (— - 1) . 7.66
T r+ eI ( )
(The tortoise coordinate is only sensibly related to r when r > 2GM, but beyond there our
coordinates aren’t very good anyway.) In terms of the tortoise coordinate the Schwarzschild
metric becomes 2GM
/1
ds? = (1 - —) (—dt2 + (17'*2> +72d0? | (7.67)
r
where r is thought of as a function of r*. This represents some progress, since the light cones
now don’t seem to close up; furthermore, none of the metric coefficients becomes infinite at
r = 2GM (although both gy and g,-+ become zero). The price we pay, however, is that the
surface of interest at r = 2GM has just been pushed to infinity.

Our next move is to define coordinates which are naturally adapted to the null geodesics.
