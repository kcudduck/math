then infalling radial null geodesics are characterized by @ = constant, while the outgoing
ones satisfy © = constant. Now consider going back to the original radial coordinate r,
but replacing the timelike coordinate ¢ with the new coordinate @. These are known as
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In terms of them the metric is
2GM
ds? = — (1 - —) da® + (dadr + drda) + r?dQ? . (7.69)

Here we see our first sign of real progress. Even though the metric coefficient gz; vanishes
at r = 2GM, there is no real degeneracy; the determinant of the metric is
g=—rtsin®6 , (7.70)
which is perfectly regular at r = 2GM. Therefore the metric is invertible, and we see once
and for all that » = 2G M is simply a coordinate singularity in our original (¢, r, 6, ¢) system.
In the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates the condition for radial null curves is solved by
di 0, (infalling)

We can therefore see what has happened: in this coordinate system the light cones remain
well-behaved at r = 2G'M, and this surface is at a finite coordinate value. There is no
problem in tracing the paths of null or timelike particles past the surface. On the other
hand, something interesting is certainly going on. Although the light cones don’t close up,
they do tilt over, such that for r < 2GM all future-directed paths are in the direction of
decreasing 7.
The surface r = 2GM, while being locally perfectly regular, globally functions as a point
of no return — once a test particle dips below it, it can never come back. For this reason
r = 2GM is known as the event horizon; no event at r < 2GM can influence any other
