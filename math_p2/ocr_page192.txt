event at > 2G M. Notice that the event horizon is a null surface, not a timelike one. Notice
also that since nothing can escape the event horizon, it is impossible for us to “see inside”
— thus the name black hole.

Let’s consider what we have done. Acting under the suspicion that our coordinates may
not have been good for the entire manifold, we have changed from our original coordinate ¢
to the new one @, which has the nice property that if we decrease r along a radial curve null
curve @ = constant, we go right through the event horizon without any problems. (Indeed, a
local observer actually making the trip would not necessarily know when the event horizon
had been crossed — the local geometry is no different than anywhere else.) We therefore
conclude that our suspicion was correct and our initial coordinate system didn’t do a good
job of covering the entire manifold. The region r < 2GM should certainly be included in
our spacetime, since physical particles can easily reach there and pass through. However,
there is no guarantee that we are finished; perhaps there are other directions in which we
can extend our manifold.

In fact there are. Notice that in the (@,r) coordinate system we can cross the event
horizon on future-directed paths, but not on past-directed ones. This seems unreasonable,
since we started with a time-independent solution. But we could have chosen ¢ instead of
1, in which case the metric would have been

ds* = — (1 - g) 3% — (dodr + drdd) + r2d9? . (7.72)
Now we can once again pass through the event horizon, but this time only along past-directed
curves.

This is perhaps a surprise: we can consistently follow either future-directed or past-
directed curves through r = 2GM, but we arrive at different places. It was actually to be
expected, since from the definitions (7.68), if we keep @ constant and decrease r we must
have ¢t — o0, while if we keep ¥ constant and decrease r we must have t — —oo. (The
tortoise coordinate r* goes to —oo as r — 2GM.) So we have extended spacetime in two
different directions, one to the future and one to the past.
