7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 186

The next step would be to follow spacelike geodesics to see if we would uncover still more
regions. The answer is yes, we would reach yet another piece of the spacetime, but let’s
shortcut the process by defining coordinates that are good all over. A first guess might be
to use both @ and ¥ at once (in place of ¢ and r), which leads to
1 2GM .
ast = (1 - G—) (didd + dadii) + r2dQ? | (7.73)
r
with r defined implicitly in terms of @ and ¥ by
1 r
S@—7) = r+2GM1n<2G’W - 1) . (7.74)
We have actually re-introduced the degeneracy with which we started out; in these coordi-
nates r = 2GM is “Infinitely far away” (at either & = —oo or © = +00). The thing to do is
to change to coordinates which pull these points into finite coordinate values; a good choice
is
o = U/AGM
v o= e VAOM (7.75)
which in terms of our original (¢,r) system is
u = ( T 1>1/2 o +0)/AGM
2GM
v o= (_r — 1)1/2 e(r—O/AGM (7.76)
2GM
In the (v, v/, 6, ¢) system the Schwarzschild metric is
16G3M3 oo,
ds? = - ——— 7" 2M(qu/dv’ + dv'du’) + r2dQ? . (7.77)
r
Finally the nonsingular nature of » = 2GM becomes completely manifest; in this form none
of the metric coefficients behave in any special way at the event horizon.
