7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 187
Both ' and v are null coordinates, in the sense that their partial derivatives 9/0u’ and
9/0v" are null vectors. There is nothing wrong with this, since the collection of four partial
derivative vectors (two null and two spacelike) in this system serve as a perfectly good basis
for the tangent space. Nevertheless, we are somewhat more comfortable working in a system
where one coordinate is timelike and the rest are spacelike. We therefore define

u = §(u’ —')

in terms of which the metric becomes
32G3M? ,
ds* = fe’r/zcw(—dv2 + du?) + r2dQ* , (7.80)
where r is defined implicitly from
(u* —?) = (2C:W - 1) e (7.81)
The coordinates (v, u,6,¢) are known as Kruskal coordinates, or sometimes Kruskal-
Szekres coordinates. Note that v is the timelike coordinate.
The Kruskal coordinates have a number of miraculous properties. Like the (¢,7*) coor-
dinates, the radial null curves look like they do in flat space:
v = £u + constant . (7.82)
Unlike the (¢, 7*) coordinates, however, the event horizon r = 2G M is not infinitely far away;
in fact it is defined by
v=tu, (7.83)
consistent with it being a null surface. More generally, we can consider the surfaces r = con-
stant. From (7.81) these satisfy
u? —v? = constant . (7.84)
Thus, they appear as hyperbolae in the u-v plane. Furthermore, the surfaces of constant ¢
are given by v
— = tanh(t/4GM) , (7.85)
