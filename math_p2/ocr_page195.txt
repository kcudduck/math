7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 188
which defines straight lines through the origin with slope tanh(t/4GM). Note that as t —
+o0 this becomes the same as (7.83); therefore these surfaces are the same as r = 2GM.
Now, our coordinates (v,u) should be allowed to range over every value they can take
without hitting the real singularity at r = 2G'M; the allowed region is therefore —oo <
u < oo and v? < u? + 1. We can now draw a spacetime diagram in the v-u plane (with
6 and ¢ suppressed), known as a “Kruskal diagram”, which represents the entire spacetime
corresponding to the Schwarzschild metric.
