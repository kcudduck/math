7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 189
Our original coordinates (¢, ) were only good for r > 2GM, which is only a part of the
manifold portrayed on the Kruskal diagram. It is convenient to divide the diagram into four
regions:

The region in which we started was region I; by following future-directed null rays we reached
region II; and by following past-directed null rays we reached region III. If we had explored
spacelike geodesics, we would have been led to region IV. The definitions (7.78) and (7.79)
which relate (u, v) to (¢,7) are really only good in region I; in the other regions it is necessary
to introduce appropriate minus signs to prevent the coordinates from becoming imaginary.

Having extended the Schwarzschild geometry as far as it will go, we have described a
remarkable spacetime. Region II, of course, is what we think of as the black hole. Once
anything travels from region I into II, it can never return. In fact, every future-directed path
in region II ends up hitting the singularity at r = 0; once you enter the event horizon, you are
utterly doomed. This is worth stressing; not only can you not escape back to region I, you
cannot even stop yourself from moving in the direction of decreasing r, since this is simply
the timelike direction. (This could have been seen in our original coordinate system; for
r < 2GM, t becomes spacelike and r becomes timelike.) Thus you can no more stop moving
toward the singularity than you can stop getting older. Since proper time is maximized along
a geodesic, you will live the longest if you don’t struggle, but just relax as you approach
the singularity. Not that you will have long to relax. (Nor that the voyage will be very
relaxing; as you approach the singularity the tidal forces become infinite. As you fall toward
the singularity your feet and head will be pulled apart from each other, while your torso
is squeezed to infinitesimal thinness. The grisly demise of an astrophysicist falling into a
black hole is detailed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, section 32.6. Note that they use
orthonormal frames [not that it makes the trip any more enjoyable].)

Regions III and IV might be somewhat unexpected. Region III is simply the time-reverse
of region II, a part of spacetime from which things can escape to us, while we can never get
there. It can be thought of as a “white hole.” There is a singularity in the past, out of which
the universe appears to spring. The boundary of region III is sometimes called the past
