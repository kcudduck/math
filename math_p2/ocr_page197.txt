7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 190
event horizon, while the boundary of region II is called the future event horizon. Region IV,
meanwhile, cannot be reached from our region I either forward or backward in time (nor can
anybody from over there reach us). It is another asymptotically flat region of spacetime, a
mirror image of ours. It can be thought of as being connected to region I by a “wormhole,” a
neck-like configuration joining two distinct regions. Consider slicing up the Kruskal diagram
into spacelike surfaces of constant v:
\

E

D

C

B

A

\
Now we can draw pictures of each slice, restoring one of the angular coordinates for clarity:
A B C D E
F 4 r=2GM
_—_— OO0
v
So the Schwarzschild geometry really describes two asymptotically flat regions which reach
toward each other, join together via a wormhole for a while, and then disconnect. But the
wormbhole closes up too quickly for any timelike observer to cross it from one region into the
next.
It might seem somewhat implausible, this story about two separate spacetimes reaching

toward each other for a while and then letting go. In fact, it is not expected to happen in
the real world, since the Schwarzschild metric does not accurately model the entire universe.
