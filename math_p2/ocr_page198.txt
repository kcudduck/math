7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 191
Remember that it is only valid in vacuum, for example outside a star. If the star has a radius
larger than 2G'M, we need never worry about any event horizons at all. But we believe that
there are stars which collapse under their own gravitational pull, shrinking down to below
r = 2G'M and further into a singularity, resulting in a black hole. There is no need for a
white hole, however, because the past of such a spacetime looks nothing like that of the full
Schwarzschild solution. Roughly, a Kruskal-like diagram for stellar collapse would look like
the following:

The shaded region is not described by Schwarzschild, so there is no need to fret about white
holes and wormholes.

While we are on the subject, we can say something about the formation of astrophysical
black holes from massive stars. The life of a star is a constant struggle between the inward
pull of gravity and the outward push of pressure. When the star is burning nuclear fuel
at its core, the pressure comes from the heat produced by this burning. (We should put
“burning” in quotes, since nuclear fusion is unrelated to oxidation.) When the fuel is used
up, the temperature declines and the star begins to shrink as gravity starts winning the
struggle. Eventually this process is stopped when the electrons are pushed so close together
that they resist further compression simply on the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle (no
two fermions can be in the same state). The resulting object is called a white dwarf. If the
mass is sufficiently high, however, even the electron degeneracy pressure is not enough, and
the electrons will combine with the protons in a dramatic phase transition. The result is a
neutron star, which consists of almost entirely neutrons (although the insides of neutron
stars are not understood terribly well). Since the conditions at the center of a neutron
star are very different from those on earth, we do not have a perfect understanding of the
equation of state. Nevertheless, we believe that a sufficiently massive neutron star will itself
