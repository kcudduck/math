7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 192
be unable to resist the pull of gravity, and will continue to collapse. Since a fluid of neutrons
is the densest material of which we can presently conceive, it is believed that the inevitable
outcome of such a collapse is a black hole.

The process is summarized in the following diagram of radius vs. mass:

M/Moq D
neutron
1.5 £ stars
B
<" dwarfs
0.5 C
A
1 2 3 4 log R (km)

The point of the diagram is that, for any given mass M, the star will decrease in radius
until it hits the line. White dwarfs are found between points A and B, and neutron stars
between points C' and D. Point B is at a height of somewhat less than 1.4 solar masses; the
height of D is less certain, but probably less than 2 solar masses. The process of collapse
is complicated, and during the evolution the star can lose or gain mass, so the endpoint of
any given star is hard to predict. Nevertheless white dwarfs are all over the place, neutron
stars are not uncommon, and there are a number of systems which are strongly believed to
contain black holes. (Of course, you can'’t directly see the black hole. What you can see is
radiation from matter accreting onto the hole, which heats up as it gets closer and emits
radiation.)

We have seen that the Kruskal coordinate system provides a very useful representation
of the Schwarzschild geometry. Before moving on to other types of black holes, we will
introduce one more way of thinking about this spacetime, the Penrose (or Carter-Penrose,
or conformal) diagram. The idea is to do a conformal transformation which brings the entire
manifold onto a compact region such that we can fit the spacetime on a piece of paper.

Let’s begin with Minkowski space, to see how the technique works. The metric in polar
coordinates is

ds? = —dt* + dr? 4 r2dQ* . (7.86)
Nothing unusual will happen to the 6, ¢ coordinates, but we will want to keep careful track
