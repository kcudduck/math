1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 13

(Very roughly speaking, “z* has an upper index, but when it is in the denominator of a

derivative it implies a lower index on the resulting object.”) I'm not a big fan of the comma

notation, but we will use 0, all the time. Note that the gradient does in fact act in a natural

way on the example we gave above of a vector, the tangent vector to a curve. The result is
ordinary derivative of the function along the curve:

As a final note on dual vectors, there is a way to represent them as pictures which is
consistent with the picture of vectors as arrows. See the discussion in Schutz, or in MTW
(where it is taken to dizzying extremes).

A straightforward generalization of vectors and dual vectors is the notion of a tensor.
Just as a dual vector is a linear map from vectors to R, a tensor T of type (or rank) (k,1)
is a multilinear map from a collection of dual vectors and vectors to R:

T: Tyx---xTyxTyx---xT, =R
(k times) (I times) (1.44)
Here, “x” denotes the Cartesian product, so that for example 7T}, x T}, is the space of ordered
pairs of vectors. Multilinearity means that the tensor acts linearly in each of its arguments;
for instance, for a tensor of type (1, 1), we have
T(aw + bn, eV +dW) = acT(w, V) + adT (w, W) + bcT'(n, V) + bdT (n, W) . (1.45)
From this point of view, a scalar is a type (0,0) tensor, a vector is a type (1,0) tensor, and
a dual vector is a type (0,1) tensor.

The space of all tensors of a fixed type (k,!) forms a vector space; they can be added
together and multiplied by real numbers. To construct a basis for this space, we need to
define a new operation known as the tensor product, denoted by ®. If T'is a (k,l) tensor
and S is a (m,n) tensor, we define a (k 4+ m,l + n) tensor ' ® S by

T@SwWW,. .. wh ktm yO yO )
=T(wW, ... w® VO YOGkt ) ) )y (1.46)
(Note that the w® and V' are distinct dual vectors and vectors, not components thereof.)
In other words, first act 7" on the appropriate set of dual vectors and vectors, and then act
S on the remainder, and then multiply the answers. Note that, in general, T® S # S®T.

It is now straightforward to construct a basis for the space of all (k, ) tensors, by taking
tensor products of basis vectors and dual vectors; this basis will consist of all tensors of the
form
