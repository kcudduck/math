of the ranges of the other two coordinates. In this case of course we have
—00 <t < 400
0<r<+c0. (7.87)
Technically the worldline = 0 represents a coordinate singularity and should be covered by
a different patch, but we all know what is going on so we’ll just act like r = 0 is well-behaved.
Our task is made somewhat easier if we switch to null coordinates:
1
w = —(t+r
u %( +7)
v o= §(t7 ), (7.88)
with corresponding ranges given by
—00 < u < +00
—00 < v < +00
v<u. (7.89)
These ranges are as portrayed in the figure, on which each point represents a 2-sphere of
t
SN~—
v = const
r
% o
P
radius r = v — v. The metric in these coordinates is given by
ds? = —2(dudv + dvdu) + (u — v)2dQ? . (7.90)
We now want to change to coordinates in which “infinity” takes on a finite coordinate
value. A good choice is
U = arctanu
