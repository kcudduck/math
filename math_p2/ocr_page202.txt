7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 195
x = U=V, (7.98)
with ranges
—nr<n<+m
0<x<+m. (7.99)
Now the metric is
ds* = w™? (7d772 +dx® +sin® y dQ2) , (7.100)
where
w = gos UcosV
= §(cosn+cosx) . (7.101)
The Minkowski metric may therefore be thought of as related by a conformal transfor-
mation to the “unphysical” metric
ds? = wids®
= —dp® +dx® +sin? y dQ? . (7.102)
This describes the manifold R x S%, where the 3-sphere is maximally symmetric and static.
There is curvature in this metric, and it is not a solution to the vacuum Einstein’s equations.
This shouldn’t bother us, since it is unphysical; the true physical metric, obtained by a
conformal transformation, is simply flat spacetime. In fact this metric is that of the “Einstein
static universe,” a static (but unstable) solution to Einstein’s equations with a perfect fluid
and a cosmological constant. Of course, the full range of coordinates on R x S% would
usually be —oo <1 < 400, 0 < x < 7, while Minkowski space is mapped into the subspace
defined by (7.99). The entire R x S? can be drawn as a cylinder, in which each circle is a
three-sphere, as shown on the next page.
