7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 196
X=m
The shaded region represents Minkowski space. Note that each point (7, x) on this cylinder
is half of a two-sphere, where the other half is the point (1, —x). We can unroll the shaded
region to portray Minkowski space as a triangle, as shown in the figure. The is the Penrose

diagram. Each point represents a two-sphere.
In fact Minkowski space is only the interior of the above diagram (including x = 0); the
boundaries are not part of the original spacetime. Together they are referred to as conformal
infinity. The structure of the Penrose diagram allows us to subdivide conformal infinity
