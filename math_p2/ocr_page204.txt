7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 197
into a few different regions:

it = future timelike infinity (n =7, x =0)

i = spatial infinity (n =0, x =)

i~ = past timelike infinity (n = -7, x =0)

It = future null infinity (n=7—x, 0 <y <m)

Z- = past null infinity (n=—-74+x, 0 < x <)
(Z* and I~ are pronounced as “scri-plus” and “scri-minus”, respectively.) Note that i,
i, and i~ are actually points, since Y = 0 and y = 7 are the north and south poles of S3.
Meanwhile Z+ and Z~ are actually null surfaces, with the topology of R x S2.

There are a number of important features of the Penrose diagram for Minkowski space-
time. The points i™, and i~ can be thought of as the limits of spacelike surfaces whose
normals are timelike; conversely, i can be thought of as the limit of timelike surfaces whose
normals are spacelike. Radial null geodesics are at +£45° in the diagram. All timelike
geodesics begin at i~ and end at iT; all null geodesics begin at Z~ and end at Z+; all space-
like geodesics both begin and end at i°. On the other hand, there can be non-geodesic
timelike curves that end at null infinity (if they become “asymptotically null”).

It is nice to be able to fit all of Minkowski space on a small piece of paper, but we don’t
really learn much that we didn’t already know. Penrose diagrams are more useful when
we want to represent slightly more interesting spacetimes, such as those for black holes.
The original use of Penrose diagrams was to compare spacetimes to Minkowski space “at
infinity” — the rigorous definition of “asymptotically flat” is basically that a spacetime has
a conformal infinity just like Minkowski space. We will not pursue these issues in detail, but
instead turn directly to analysis of the Penrose diagram for a Schwarzschild black hole.

We will not go through the necessary manipulations in detail, since they parallel the
Minkowski case with considerable additional algebraic complexity. We would start with the
null version of the Kruskal coordinates, in which the metric takes the form

Then essentially the same transformation as was used in flat spacetime suffices to bring
infinity into finite coordinate values:
u’ = arctan v
