The (u”,v") part of the metric (that is, at constant angular coordinates) is now conformally
related to Minkowski space. In the new coordinates the singularities at r = 0 are straight
lines that stretch from timelike infinity in one asymptotic region to timelike infinity in the
other. The Penrose diagram for the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution thus looks
like this:
i+ =0 it
1+

i r=0 i
The only real subtlety about this diagram is the necessity to understand that i+ and i~ are
distinct from r = 0 (there are plenty of timelike paths that do not hit the singularity). Notice
also that the structure of conformal infinity is just like that of Minkowski space, consistent
with the claim that Schwarzschild is asymptotically flat. Also, the Penrose diagram for a
collapsing star that forms a black hole is what you might expect, as shown on the next page.
Once again the Penrose diagrams for these spacetimes don’t really tell us anything we
didn’t already know; their usefulness will become evident when we consider more general
black holes. In principle there could be a wide variety of types of black holes, depending on
the process by which they were formed. Surprisingly, however, this turns out not to be the
case; no matter how a black hole is formed, it settles down (fairly quickly) into a state which
is characterized only by the mass, charge, and angular momentum. This property, which
must be demonstrated individually for the various types of fields which one might imagine
go into the construction of the hole, is often stated as “black holes have no hair.” You
