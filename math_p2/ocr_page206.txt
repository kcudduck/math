can demonstrate, for example, that a hole which is formed from an initially inhomogeneous
collapse “shakes off” any lumpiness by emitting gravitational radiation. This is an example
of a “no-hair theorem.” If we are interested in the form of the black hole after it has settled
down, we thus need only to concern ourselves with charged and rotating holes. In both cases
there exist exact solutions for the metric, which we can examine closely.

But first let’s take a brief detour to the world of black hole evaporation. It is strange to
think of a black hole “evaporating,” but in the real world black holes aren’t truly black —
they radiate energy as if they were a blackbody of temperature T' = h/87kG M, where M is
the mass of the hole and & is Boltzmann’s constant. The derivation of this effect, known as
Hawking radiation, involves the use of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and is way
outside our scope right now. The informal idea is nevertheless understandable. In quantum
field theory there are “vacuum fluctuations” — the spontaneous creation and annihilation
of particle/antiparticle pairs in empty space. These fluctuations are precisely analogous to
the zero-point fluctuations of a simple harmonic oscillator. Normally such fluctuations are
