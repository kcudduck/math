7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 200
impossible to detect, since they average out to give zero total energy (although nobody knows
why; that’s the cosmological constant problem). In the presence of an event horizon, though,
occasionally one member of a virtual pair will fall into the black hole while its partner escapes
to infinity. The particle that reaches infinity will have to have a positive energy, but the
total energy is conserved; therefore the black hole has to lose mass. (If you like you can
think of the particle that falls in as having a negative mass.) We see the escaping particles
as Hawking radiation. It’s not a very big effect, and the temperature goes down as the mass
goes up, so for black holes of mass comparable to the sun it is completely negligible. Still,
in principle the black hole could lose all of its mass to Hawking radiation, and shrink to
nothing in the process. The relevant Penrose diagram might look like this:
i+
r=0 &
r=0
.‘-‘- i()
//// 4diarion
r=0
.
i

On the other hand, it might not. The problem with this diagram is that “information
is lost” — if we draw a spacelike surface to the past of the singularity and evolve it into
the future, part of it ends up crashing into the singularity and being destroyed. As a result
the radiation itself contains less information than the information that was originally in the
spacetime. (This is the worse than a lack of hair on the black hole. It’s one thing to think
that information has been trapped inside the event horizon, but it is more worrisome to think
that it has disappeared entirely.) But such a process violates the conservation of information
that is implicit in both general relativity and quantum field theory, the two theories that led
to the prediction. This paradox is considered a big deal these days, and there are a number
of efforts to understand how the information can somehow be retrieved. A currently popular
explanation relies on string theory, and basically says that black holes have a lot of hair,
in the form of virtual stringy states living near the event horizon. I hope you will not be
disappointed to hear that we won’t look at this very closely; but you should know what the
problem is and that it is an area of active research these days.
