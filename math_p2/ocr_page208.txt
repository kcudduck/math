7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 201
With that out of our system, we now turn to electrically charged black holes. These
seem at first like reasonable enough objects, since there is certainly nothing to stop us
from throwing some net charge into a previously uncharged black hole. In an astrophysical
situation, however, the total amount of charge is expected to be very small, especially when
compared with the mass (in terms of the relative gravitational effects). Nevertheless, charged
black holes provide a useful testing ground for various thought experiments, so they are worth
our consideration.
In this case the full spherical symmetry of the problem is still present; we know therefore
that we can write the metric as
ds? = —e2 002 4 2800 dp? 4 12402 . (7.106)
Now, however, we are no longer in vacuum, since the hole will have a nonzero electromagnetic
field, which in turn acts as a source of energy-momentum. The energy-momentum tensor
for electromagnetism is given by
T*lFFplFF‘”’ 7.107
W*E( wpt'vs = g G tipo ) (7.107)
where F),, is the electromagnetic field strength tensor. Since we have spherical symmetry,
the most general field strength tensor will have components
F, = f(T'., t) =l
Fyy = g(r.t)sind =—Fy , (7.108)
where f(r,t) and g(r,t) are some functions to be determined by the field equations, and
components not written are zero. [}, corresponds to a radial electric field, while Fy, corre-
sponds to a radial magnetic field. (For those of you wondering about the sin @, recall that
the thing which should be independent of 6 and ¢ is the radial component of the magnetic
field, B" = €' F,,. For a spherically symmetric metric, e”* = ﬁg"‘”‘" is proportional
to (sinf)~!, so we want a factor of sinf in Fy,.) The field equations in this case are both
Einstein’s equations and Maxwell’s equations:
9"V F,e = 0
ViuF,,) = 0. (7.109)
The two sets are coupled together, since the electromagnetic field strength tensor enters
Einstein’s equations through the energy-momentum tensor, while the metric enters explicitly
into Maxwell’s equations.
The difficulties are not insurmountable, however, and a procedure similar to the one we
followed for the vacuum case leads to a solution for the charged case as well. We will not
