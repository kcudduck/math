7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 202
go through the steps explicitly, but merely quote the final answer. The solution is known as
the Reissner-Nordstrgm metric, and is given by
ds® = —Adt* + A71dr? +r2d0? | (7.110)
where s
A=1—M+G(p7;rq). (7.111)
r r
In this expression, M is once again interpreted as the mass of the hole; ¢ is the total electric
charge, and p is the total magnetic charge. Isolated magnetic charges (monopoles) have never
been observed in nature, but that doesn’t stop us from writing down the metric that they
would produce if they did exist. There are good theoretical reasons to think that monopoles
exist, but are extremely rare. (Of course, there is also the possibility that a black hole
could have magnetic charge even if there aren’t any monopoles.) In fact the electric and
magnetic charges enter the metric in the same way, so we are not introducing any additional
complications by keeping p in our expressions. The electromagnetic fields associated with
this solution are given by
By = %
Fyy = psinf . (7.112)
Conservatives are welcome to set p = 0 if they like.

The structure of singularities and event horizons is more complicated in this metric than
it was in Schwarzschild, due to the extra term in the function A(r) (which can be thought of
as measuring “how much the light cones tip over”). One thing remains the same: at r = 0
there is a true curvature singularity (as could be checked by computing the curvature scalar
Rype R*P7). Meanwhile, the equivalent of 7 = 2GM will be the radius where A vanishes.
This will occur at

re =GM £ /G*M? — G(p* + ¢?) . (7.113)
This might constitute two, one, or zero solutions, depending on the relative values of G M?
and p? + ¢°. We therefore consider each case separately.
Case One — GM?* < p* + ¢*

In this case the coefficient A is always positive (never zero), and the metric is completely
regular in the (¢,7,0, ¢) coordinates all the way down to r = 0. The coordinate ¢ is always
timelike, and r is always spacelike. But there still is the singularity at » = 0, which is now a
timelike line. Since there is no event horizon, there is no obstruction to an observer travelling
to the singularity and returning to report on what was observed. This is known as a naked
singularity, one which is not shielded by an horizon. A careful analysis of the geodesics
