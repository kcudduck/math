1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 14
In a 4-dimensional spacetime there will be 4** basis tensors in all. In component notation
we then write our arbitrary tensor as

T =TM" M, e @ ® e @0 @ @4 . (1.48)
Alternatively, we could define the components by acting the tensor on basis vectors and dual
vectors:

Tt = TOWD W) 6 Ey) (1.49)

You can check for yourself, using (1.33) and so forth, that these equations all hang together
properly.

As with vectors, we will usually take the shortcut of denoting the tensor 7" by its com-
ponents T+ #, . The action of the tensors on a set of vectors and dual vectors follows
the pattern established in (1.35):

TW, . . o® v y0) = T“l"'“’“,,l.“,,lell) X -wL’Z)Vu)”l R 40O (1.50)
The order of the indices is obviously important, since the tensor need not act in the same way
on its various arguments. Finally, the transformation of tensor components under Lorentz
transformations can be derived by applying what we already know about the transformation
of basis vectors and dual vectors. The answer is just what you would expect from index
placement,
T"'/l""‘;«,,i.“y[ = A“/lu1 . -A"’@F%A,,i”1 c AT (1.51)
Thus, each upper index gets transformed like a vector, and each lower index gets transformed
like a dual vector.

Although we have defined tensors as linear maps from sets of vectors and tangent vectors
to R, there is nothing that forces us to act on a full collection of arguments. Thus, a (1,1)
tensor also acts as a map from vectors to vectors:

™, : V¥ - TH, V" . (1.52)
You can check for yourself that 7%, V" is a vector (i.e. obeys the vector transformation law).
Similarly, we can act one tensor on (all or part of) another tensor to obtain a third tensor.
For example,
Uk, =T",5%,, (1.53)
is a perfectly good (1,1) tensor.

You may be concerned that this introduction to tensors has been somewhat too brief,
given the esoteric nature of the material. In fact, the notion of tensors does not require a
great deal of effort to master; it’s just a matter of keeping the indices straight, and the rules
for manipulating them are very natural. Indeed, a number of books like to define tensors as
