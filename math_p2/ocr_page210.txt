reveals, however, that the singularity is “repulsive” — timelike geodesics never intersect
r = 0, instead they approach and then reverse course and move away. (Null geodesics can
reach the singularity, as can non-geodesic timelike curves.)

As r — oo the solution approaches flat spacetime, and as we have just seen the causal
structure is “normal” everywhere. The Penrose diagram will therefore be just like that of
Minkowski space, except that now r = 0 is a singularity.

The nakedness of the singularity offends our sense of decency, as well as the cosmic cen-
sorship conjecture, which roughly states that the gravitational collapse of physical matter
configurations will never produce a naked singularity. (Of course, it’s just a conjecture, and it
may not be right; there are some claims from numerical simulations that collapse of spindle-
like configurations can lead to naked singularities.) In fact, we should not ever expect to find
