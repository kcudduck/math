7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 204
a black hole with GM? < p? + ¢? as the result of gravitational collapse. Roughly speaking,
this condition states that the total energy of the hole is less than the contribution to the
energy from the electromagnetic fields alone — that is, the mass of the matter which carried
the charge would have had to be negative. This solution is therefore generally considered
to be unphysical. Notice also that there are not good Cauchy surfaces (spacelike slices for
which every inextendible timelike line intersects them) in this spacetime, since timelike lines
can begin and end at the singularity.

Case Two — GM? > p* + ¢*

This is the situation which we expect to apply in real gravitational collapse; the energy
in the electromagnetic field is less than the total energy. In this case the metric coefficient
A(r) is positive at large r and small r, and negative inside the two vanishing points ry =
GM + /G*M? — G(p? + ¢?). The metric has coordinate singularities at both r, and r_; in
both cases these could be removed by a change of coordinates as we did with Schwarzschild.

The surfaces defined by r = r4 are both null, and in fact they are event horizons (in a
sense we will make precise in a moment). The singularity at r = 0 is a timelike line (not
a spacelike surface as in Schwarzschild). If you are an observer falling into the black hole
from far away, r; is just like 2GM in the Schwarzschild metric; at this radius r switches
from being a spacelike coordinate to a timelike coordinate, and you necessarily move in the
direction of decreasing r. Witnesses outside the black hole also see the same phenomena
that they would outside an uncharged hole — the infalling observer is seen to move more
and more slowly, and is increasingly redshifted.

But the inevitable fall from r to ever-decreasing radii only lasts until you reach the null
surface r = r_, where r switches back to being a spacelike coordinate and the motion in the
direction of decreasing r can be arrested. Therefore you do not have to hit the singularity
at r = 0; this is to be expected, since r = 0 is a timelike line (and therefore not necessarily
in your future). In fact you can choose either to continue on to r = 0, or begin to move
in the direction of increasing r back through the null surface at » = r_. Then r will once
again be a timelike coordinate, but with reversed orientation; you are forced to move in the
direction of increasing r. You will eventually be spit out past » = r, once more, which is
like emerging from a white hole into the rest of the universe. From here you can choose to
go back into the black hole — this time, a different hole than the one you entered in the
first place — and repeat the voyage as many times as you like. This little story corresponds
to the accompanying Penrose diagram, which of course can be derived more rigorously by
choosing appropriate coordinates and analytically extending the Reissner-Nordstrgm metric
as far as it will go.

How much of this is science, as opposed to science fiction? Probably not much. If you
think about the world as seen from an observer inside the black hole who is about to cross the
event horizon at r_, you will notice that they can look back in time to see the entire history
