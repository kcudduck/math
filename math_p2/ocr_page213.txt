7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 206
of the external (asymptotically flat) universe, at least as seen from the black hole. But they
see this (infinitely long) history in a finite amount of their proper time — thus, any signal
that gets to them as they approach r_ is infinitely blueshifted. Therefore it is reasonable
to believe (although I know of no proof) that any non-spherically symmetric perturbation
that comes into a Reissner-Nordstrgm black hole will violently disturb the geometry we have
described. It’s hard to say what the actual geometry will look like, but there is no very
good reason to believe that it must contain an infinite number of asymptotically flat regions
connecting to each other via various wormholes.

Case Three — GM? = p? + ¢?

This case is known as the extreme Reissner-Nordstrgm solution (or simply “extremal
black hole”). The mass is exactly balanced in some sense by the charge — you can construct
exact solutions consisting of several extremal black holes which remain stationary with re-
spect to each other for all time. On the one hand the extremal hole is an amusing theoretical
toy; these solutions are often examined in studies of the information loss paradox, and the
role of black holes in quantum gravity. On the other hand it appears very unstable, since
adding just a little bit of matter will bring it to Case Two.

The extremal black holes have A(r) = 0 at a single radius, r = GM. This does represent
an event horizon, but the r coordinate is never timelike; it becomes null at » = GM, but is
spacelike on either side. The singularity at » = 0 is a timelike line, as in the other cases. So
