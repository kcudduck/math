7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 207
for this black hole you can again avoid the singularity and continue to move to the future
to extra copies of the asymptotically flat region, but the singularity is always “to the left.”
The Penrose diagram is as shown.

We could of course go into a good deal more detail about the charged solutions, but let’s
instead move on to spinning black holes. It is much more difficult to find the exact solution
for the metric in this case, since we have given up on spherical symmetry. To begin with
all that is present is axial symmetry (around the axis of rotation), but we can also ask for
stationary solutions (a timelike Killing vector). Although the Schwarzschild and Reissner-
Nordstrgm solutions were discovered soon after general relativity was invented, the solution
for a rotating black hole was found by Kerr only in 1963. His result, the Kerr metric, is
given by the following mess:

2 2GMr
ds® = —dt* + %drz + p*d0° + (r* + a®) sin* 0 d¢® + ——(asin®0dg — dt)* ,  (7.114)
P

where

A(r) =r* = 2GMr + a* , (7.115)
and

p2(r,0) = r® + a*cos’ 0 . (7.116)
Here a measures the rotation of the hole and M is the mass. It is straightforward to include
electric and magnetic charges q and p, simply by replacing 2G Mr with 2GMr — (¢* + p?) /G;
the result is the Kerr-Newman metric. All of the interesting phenomena persist in the
absence of charges, so we will set ¢ = p = 0 from now on.

The coordinates (t,7,6,¢) are known as Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. It is straight-
forward to check that as @ — 0 they reduce to Schwarzschild coordinates. If we keep a fixed
and let M — 0, however, we recover flat spacetime but not in ordinary polar coordinates.
The metric becomes

2 2000202
cos® 6
ds® = —dt* + %dr2 + (r? + a* cos? 0)2d0* + (r* + a®)sin*0dg® ,  (7.117)
r’+a
and we recognize the spatial part of this as flat space in ellipsoidal coordinates.
They are related to Cartesian coordinates in Euclidean 3-space by
z = (r*4a®)Y*sin6 cos(¢)
y = (r+a*)"*sin sin(¢)
z = rcosf . (7.118)

There are two Killing vectors of the metric (7.114), both of which are manifest; since the

metric coefficients are independent of ¢ and ¢, both (#* = 9, and n* = 9,, are Killing vectors.
