Of course n* expresses the axial symmetry of the solution. The vector ¢* is not orthogonal to
t = constant hypersurfaces, and in fact is not orthogonal to any hypersurfaces at all; hence
this metric is stationary, but not static. (It’s not changing with time, but it is spinning,)
What is more, the Kerr metric also possesses something called a Killing tensor. This
is any symmetric (0,n) tensor £,,...,, which satisfies
Viousopn) =0 - (7.119)
Simple examples of Killing tensors are the metric itself, and symmetrized tensor products of
Killing vectors. Just as a Killing vector implies a constant of geodesic motion, if there exists
a Killing tensor then along a geodesic we will have

(Unlike Killing vectors, higher-rank Killing tensors do not correspond to symmetries of the
metric.) In the Kerr geometry we can define the (0, 2) tensor
