7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 209
(For what it is worth, they are the “special null vectors” of the Petrov classification for this
spacetime.) With these definitions, you can check for yourself that ¢, is a Killing tensor.

Let’s think about the structure of the full Kerr solution. Singularities seem to appear at
both A =0 and p = 0; let’s turn our attention first to A = 0. As in the Reissner-Nordstrgm
solution there are three possibilities: GZM? > a?, G?M? = a?, and G?M? < a®. The last
case features a naked singularity, and the extremal case G2M? = a? is unstable, just as in
Reissner-Nordstrgm. Since these cases are of less physical interest, and time is short, we will
concentrate on G2M? > a?. Then there are two radii at which A vanishes, given by

re =GM £ VG*M? — a? . (7.124)
Both radii are null surfaces which will turn out to be event horizons. The analysis of these
surfaces proceeds in close analogy with the Reissner-Nordstrem case; it is straightforward to
find coordinates which extend through the horizons.

Besides the event horizons at r., the Kerr solution also features an additional surface
of interest. Recall that in the spherically symmetric solutions, the “timelike” Killing vector
(" = 9, actually became null on the (outer) event horizon, and spacelike inside. Checking
to see where the analogous thing happens for Kerr, we compute

"Gy = —— (A —a’sin®0) . (7.125)
P
This does not vanish at the outer event horizon; in fact, at r = r, (where A = 0), we have
a .,
"G = pe sin®6 >0 . (7.126)
So the Killing vector is already spacelike at the outer horizon, except at the north and south
poles (6 = 0) where it is null. The locus of points where ¢#¢, = 0 is known as the Killing
horizon, and is given by
(r—GM)* = G*M?* - a*cos 0, (7.127)
while the outer event horizon is given by
(ry —GM)? = G*M?* — a* . (7.128)
There is thus a region in between these two surfaces, known as the ergosphere. Inside the
ergosphere, you must move in the direction of the rotation of the black hole (the ¢ direction);
however, you can still towards or away from the event horizon (and there is no trouble exiting
the ergosphere). It is evidently a place where interesting things can happen even before you
cross the horizon; more details on this later.
