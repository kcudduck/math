Before rushing to draw Penrose diagrams, we need to understand the nature of the true
curvature singularity; this does not occur at » = 0 in this spacetime, but rather at p = 0.
Since p? = r? + a®cos?§ is the sum of two manifestly nonnegative quantities, it can only
vanish when both quantities are zero, or

r=20, 0=—. (7.129)

This seems like a funny result, but remember that » = 0 is not a point in space, but a disk;
the set of points r = 0, § = 7/2 is actually the ring at the edge of this disk. The rotation
has “softened” the Schwarzschild singularity, spreading it out over a ring.

What happens if you go inside the ring? A careful analytic continuation (which we will
not perform) would reveal that you exit to another asymptotically flat spacetime, but not an
identical copy of the one you came from. The new spacetime is described by the Kerr metric
with r < 0. As a result, A never vanishes and there are no horizons. The Penrose diagram
is much like that for Reissner-Nordstrem, except now you can pass through the singularity.

Not only do we have the usual strangeness of these distinct asymptotically flat regions
connected to ours through the black hole, but the region near the ring singularity has addi-
tional pathologies: closed timelike curves. If you consider trajectories which wind around in
¢ while keeping # and ¢ constant and r a small negative value, the line element along such
a path is

2GM
ds* = a? (1 + —) de?* (7.130)
r
which is negative for small negative r. Since these paths are closed, they are obviously
CTC’s. You can therefore meet yourself in the past, with all that entails.

Of course, everything we say about the analytic extension of Kerr is subject to the same
caveats we mentioned for Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrgm; it is unlikely that realistic
gravitational collapse leads to these bizarre spacetimes. It is nevertheless always useful to
have exact solutions. Furthermore, for the Kerr metric there are strange things happening
even if we stay outside the event horizon, to which we now turn.
