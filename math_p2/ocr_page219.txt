7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 212
We begin by considering more carefully the angular velocity of the hole. Obviously the
conventional definition of angular velocity will have to be modified somewhat before we can
apply it to something as abstract as the metric of spacetime. Let us consider the fate of a
photon which is emitted in the ¢ direction at some radius r in the equatorial plane (0 = 7/2)
of a Kerr black hole. The instant it is emitted its momentum has no components in the r or
0 direction, and therefore the condition that it be null is
ds® = 0 = gudt® + gig(dtde + dgdt) + geedd” . (7.131)
This can be immediately solved to obtain

If we evaluate this quantity on the Killing horizon of the Kerr metric, we have g, = 0, and
the two solutions are

dt dt  (2GM)? + a?
The nonzero solution has the same sign as a; we interpret this as the photon moving around
the hole in the same direction as the hole’s rotation. The zero solution means that the
photon directed against the hole’s rotation doesn’t move at all in this coordinate system.
(This isn’t a full solution to the photon’s trajectory, just the statement that its instantaneous
velocity is zero.) This is an example of the “dragging of inertial frames” mentioned earlier.
The point of this exercise is to note that massive particles, which must move more slowly
than photons, are necessarily dragged along with the hole’s rotation once they are inside the
Killing horizon. This dragging continues as we approach the outer event horizon at r,; we
can define the angular velocity of the event horizon itself, Qg, to be the minimum angular
velocity of a particle at the horizon. Directly from (7.132) we find that
Qy = <%>7 (ry) = ﬁ . (7.134)
Now let’s turn to geodesic motion, which we know will be simplified by considering the
conserved quantities associated with the Killing vectors ¢(# = 0; and n* = 0. For the
purposes at hand we can restrict our attention to massive particles, for which we can work
with the four-momentum

where m is the rest mass of the particle. Then we can take as our two conserved quantities
the actual energy and angular momentum of the particle,
