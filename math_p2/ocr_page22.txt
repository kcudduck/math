1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 15
collections of numbers transforming according to (1.51). While this is operationally useful, it
tends to obscure the deeper meaning of tensors as geometrical entities with a life independent
of any chosen coordinate system. There is, however, one subtlety which we have glossed over.
The notions of dual vectors and tensors and bases and linear maps belong to the realm of
linear algebra, and are appropriate whenever we have an abstract vector space at hand. In
the case of interest to us we have not just a vector space, but a vector space at each point in
spacetime. More often than not we are interested in tensor fields, which can be thought of
as tensor-valued functions on spacetime. Fortunately, none of the manipulations we defined
above really care whether we are dealing with a single vector space or a collection of vector
spaces, one for each event. We will be able to get away with simply calling things functions
of x#* when appropriate. However, you should keep straight the logical independence of the
notions we have introduced and their specific application to spacetime and relativity.

Now let’s turn to some examples of tensors. First we consider the previous example of
column vectors and their duals, row vectors. In this system a (1, 1) tensor is simply a matrix,
M;. Tts action on a pair (w, V) is given by usual matrix multiplication:

MYy MYy, - ML, Vi
M?% M2, - MZ, V2
MW, V) =(wwy -+ wa) | S S| =wMGVI L (154)
MM My - MM, vr
If you like, feel free to think of tensors as “matrices with an arbitrary number of indices.”

In spacetime, we have already seen some examples of tensors without calling them that.
The most familiar example of a (0,2) tensor is the metric, 7,,. The action of the metric on
two vectors is so useful that it gets its own name, the inner product (or dot product):

n(V,W) =n,VW"=V.-W . (1.55)

Just as with the conventional Euclidean dot product, we will refer to two vectors whose dot
product vanishes as orthogonal. Since the dot product is a scalar, it is left invariant under
Lorentz transformations; therefore the basis vectors of any Cartesian inertial frame, which
are chosen to be orthogonal by definition, are still orthogonal after a Lorentz transformation
(despite the “scissoring together” we noticed earlier). The norm of a vector is defined to be
inner product of the vector with itself; unlike in Euclidean space, this number is not positive
definite:

<0, V*is timelike

if 7, VHVY is { =0, V*is lightlike or null
>0, V" is spacelike .
