(These differ from our previous definitions for the conserved quantities, where £ and L were
taken to be the energy and angular momentum per unit mass. They are conserved either
way, of course.)

The minus sign in the definition of E is there because at infinity both (* and p* are
timelike, so their inner product is negative, but we want the energy to be positive. Inside
the ergosphere, however, (* becomes spacelike; we can therefore imagine particles for which

E=—(p'<0. (7.138)
The extent to which this bothers us is ameliorated somewhat by the realization that all
particles outside the Killing horizon must have positive energies; therefore a particle inside
the ergosphere with negative energy must either remain on a geodesic inside the Killing
horizon, or be accelerated until its energy is positive if it is to escape.

Still, this realization leads to a way to extract energy from a rotating black hole; the
method is known as the Penrose process. The idea is simple; starting from outside the
ergosphere, you arm yourself with a large rock and leap toward the black hole. If we call the
four-momentum of the (you + rock) system p(¥#, then the energy E(© = 7@1)(0)“ is certainly
positive, and conserved as you move along your geodesic. Once you enter the ergosphere,
you hurl the rock with all your might, in a very specific way. If we call your momentum
pM# and that of the rock p®#, then at the instant you throw it we have conservation of
momentum just as in special relativity:

pOr = pe 4 @k (7.139)
Contracting with the Killing vector ¢, gives

E© =g 4 p® (7.140)
But, if we imagine that you are arbitrarily strong (and accurate), you can arrange your
throw such that E® < 0, as per (7.158). Furthermore, Penrose was able to show that you
can arrange the initial trajectory and the throw such that afterwards you follow a geodesic
trajectory back outside the Killing horizon into the external universe. Since your energy is
conserved along the way, at the end we will have

EO > O (7.141)

Thus, you have emerged with more energy than you entered with.
