There is no such thing as a free lunch; the energy you gained came from somewhere,
and that somewhere is the black hole. In fact, the Penrose process extracts energy from the
rotating black hole by decreasing its angular momentum; you have to throw the rock against
the hole’s rotation to get the trick to work. To see this more precisely, define a new Killing
vector

X' =+ Qunt (7.142)
On the outer horizon x* is null and tangent to the horizon. (This can be seen from (* = 9,,
Nt = Oy, and the definition (7.134) of Qp.) The statement that the particle with momentum
p@* crosses the event horizon “moving forwards in time” is simply
PPy, <0 . (7.143)
Plugging in the definitions of F and L, we see that this condition is equivalent to
E®
I® <= (7.144)
Qp
Since we have arranged E® to be negative, and Qy is positive, we see that the particle must
have a negative angular momentum — it is moving against the hole’s rotation. Once you
have escaped the ergosphere and the rock has fallen inside the event horizon, the mass and
angular momentum of the hole are what they used to be plus the negative contributions of
the rock:
oM = E@
6 = L®, (7.145)
Here we have introduced the notation J for the angular momentum of the black hole; it is
given by
J=Ma . (7.146)
