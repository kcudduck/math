7 THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES 216

The irreducibility of M;,, leads immediately to the fact that the area A can never decrease.
From (7.149) and (7.150) we have

a
0A = SWGW(M\J —Qudy), (7.153)
which can be recast as .
oM = %6A +QpéJ (7.154)
where we have introduced
o VEME —a? (7.155)
2GM(GM + /G*M? — a?)
The quantity « is known as the surface gravity of the black hole.

It was equations like (7.154) that first started people thinking about the relationship

between black holes and thermodynamics. Consider the first law of thermodynamics,

dU = TdS + work terms . (7.156)
It is natural to think of the term Qy0.J as “work” that we do on the black hole by throwing
rocks into it. Then the thermodynamic analogy begins to take shape if we think of identifying
the area A as the entropy S, and the surface gravity x as 8rG times the temperature
T. In fact, in the context of classical general relativity the analogy is essentially perfect.
The “zeroth” law of thermodynamics states that in thermal equilibrium the temperature is
constant throughout the system; the analogous statement for black holes is that stationary
black holes have constant surface gravity on the entire horizon (true). As we have seen,
the first law (7.156) is equivalent to (7.154). The second law, that entropy never decreases,
is simply the statement that the area of the horizon never decreases. Finally, the third
law is that it is impossible to achieve 7" = 0 in any physical process, which should imply
that it is impossible to achieve x = 0 in any physical process. It turns out that k = 0
corresponds to the extremal black holes (either in Kerr or Reissner-Nordstrom) — where
the naked singularities would appear. Somehow, then, the third law is related to cosmic
censorship.

The missing piece is that real thermodynamic bodies don’t just sit there; they give off
blackbody radiation with a spectrum that depends on their temperature. Black holes, it was
thought before Hawking discovered his radiation, don’t do that, since they’re truly black.
Historically, Bekenstein came up with the idea that black holes should really be honest black
bodies, including the radiation at the appropriate temperature. This annoyed Hawking, who
set out to prove him wrong, and ended up proving that there would be radiation after all.
So the thermodynamic analogy is even better than we had any right to expect — although
it is safe to say that nobody really knows why.
