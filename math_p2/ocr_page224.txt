8 Cosmology

Contemporary cosmological models are based on the idea that the universe is pretty much
the same everywhere — a stance sometimes known as the Copernican principle. On the
face of it, such a claim seems preposterous; the center of the sun, for example, bears little
resemblance to the desolate cold of interstellar space. But we take the Copernican principle
to only apply on the very largest scales, where local variations in density are averaged
over. Its validity on such scales is manifested in a number of different observations, such
as number counts of galaxies and observations of diffuse X-ray and 7-ray backgrounds, but
is most clear in the 3° microwave background radiation. Although we now know that the
microwave background is not perfectly smooth (and nobody ever expected that it was), the
deviations from regularity are on the order of 10=° or less, certainly an adequate basis for
an approximate description of spacetime on large scales.

The Copernican principle is related to two more mathematically precise properties that
a manifold might have: isotropy and homogeneity. Isotropy applies at some specific point
in the space, and states that the space looks the same no matter what direction you look in.
More formally, a manifold M is isotropic around a point p if, for any two vectors V' and W
in T,M, there is an isometry of M such that the pushforward of W under the isometry is
parallel with V' (not pushed forward). It is isotropy which is indicated by the observations
of the microwave background.

Homogeneity is the statement that the metric is the same throughout the space. In
other words, given any two points p and ¢ in M, there is an isometry which takes p into g.
Note that there is no necessary relationship between homogeneity and isotropy; a manifold
can be homogeneous but nowhere isotropic (such as R x S? in the usual metric), or it can
be isotropic around a point without being homogeneous (such as a cone, which is isotropic
around its vertex but certainly not homogeneous). On the other hand, if a space is isotropic
everywhere then it is homogeneous. (Likewise if it is isotropic around one point and also
homogeneous, it will be isotropic around every point.) Since there is ample observational
evidence for isotropy, and the Copernican principle would have us believe that we are not
the center of the universe and therefore observers elsewhere should also observe isotropy, we
will henceforth assume both homogeneity and isotropy.

There is one catch. When we look at distant galaxies, they appear to be receding from us;
the universe is apparently not static, but changing with time. Therefore we begin construc-
tion of cosmological models with the idea that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in
space, but not in time. In general relativity this translates into the statement that the uni-
verse can be foliated into spacelike slices such that each slice is homogeneous and isotropic.
