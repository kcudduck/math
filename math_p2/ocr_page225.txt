We therefore consider our spacetime to be R x X, where R represents the time direction
and ¥ is a homogeneous and isotropic three-manifold. The usefulness of homogeneity and
isotropy is that they imply that ¥ must be a maximally symmetric space. (Think of isotropy
as invariance under rotations, and homogeneity as invariance under translations. Then ho-
mogeneity and isotropy together imply that a space has its maximum possible number of
Killing vectors.) Therefore we can take our metric to be of the form
ds? = —dt* + a®(t)yi;(v)du'du’ . (8.1)
Here ¢ is the timelike coordinate, and (u',u?,u®) are the coordinates on X; ~;; is the max-
imally symmetric metric on ¥. This formula is a special case of (7.2), which we used to
derive the Schwarzschild metric, except we have scaled t such that g, = —1. The function
a(t) is known as the scale factor, and it tells us “how big” the spacelike slice ¥ is at the
moment ¢. The coordinates used here, in which the metric is free of cross terms d¢ du’ and
the spacelike components are proportional to a single function of ¢, are known as comoving
coordinates, and an observer who stays at constant u’ is also called “comoving”. Only
a comoving observer will think that the universe looks isotropic; in fact on Earth we are
not quite comoving, and as a result we see a dipole anisotropy in the cosmic microwave
background as a result of the conventional Doppler effect.
Our interest is therefore in maximally symmetric Euclidean three-metrics 7;;. We know
that maximally symmetric metrics obey
(:S)Rijkl = k(v — Yavin) (82)
where k is some constant, and we put a superscript @) on the Riemann tensor to remind us
that it is associated with the three-metric v;;, not the metric of the entire spacetime. The
Ricci tensor is then
Ry = 2k . (8.3)
If the space is to be maximally symmetric, then it will certainly be spherically symmetric.
We already know something about spherically symmetric spaces from our exploration of the
Schwarzschild solution; the metric can be put in the form
do? = yydu’ dw? = e dr? + r2(d6? + sin 0 dg?) . (8.4)
The components of the Ricci tensor for such a metric can be obtained from (7.16), the Ricci
tensor for a spherically symmetric spacetime, by setting a = 0 and 9y = 0, which gives
