We set these proportional to the metric using (8.3), and can solve for 3(r):

This gives us the following metric on spacetime:

This is the Robertson-Walker metric. We have not yet made use of Einstein’s equations;
those will determine the behavior of the scale factor a(t).
Note that the substitutions

leave (8.7) invariant. Therefore the only relevant parameter is k/|k|, and there are three
cases of interest: k = —1, k = 0, and k = +1. The k = —1 case corresponds to constant
negative curvature on X, and is called open; the k = 0 case corresponds to no curvature on
3, and is called flat; the & = +1 case corresponds to positive curvature on ¥, and is called
closed.
Let us examine each of these possibilities. For the flat case k = 0 the metric on X is
do® = dr? +r’dQ?
= da? +dy? +d2?, (8.9)
which is simply flat Euclidean space. Globally, it could describe R? or a more complicated
manifold, such as the three-torus S' x S' x S'. For the closed case k = +1 we can define
r = sin y to write the metric on ¥ as
do® = dx?* 4 sin? x dQ? | (8.10)
which is the metric of a three-sphere. In this case the only possible global structure is
actually the three-sphere (except for the non-orientable manifold RP?). Finally in the open
k = —1 case we can set r = sinh ¢ to obtain
do® = d® + sinh? ¢ dQ? . (8.11)
This is the metric for a three-dimensional space of constant negative curvature; it is hard
to visualize, but think of the saddle example we spoke of in Section Three. Globally such
a space could extend forever (which is the origin of the word “open”), but it could also
