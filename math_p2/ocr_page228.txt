With one index raised this takes the more convenient form
", = diag(—p,p,p,p) - (8.18)
Note that the trace is given by
T=T' =—p+3p. (8.19)
Before plugging in to Einstein’s equations, it is educational to consider the zero compo-
nent of the conservation of energy equation:

To make progress it is necessary to choose an equation of state, a relationship between p
and p. Essentially all of the perfect fluids relevant to cosmology obey the simple equation of
state
p=wp, (8.21)

The two most popular examples of cosmological fluids are known as dust and radiation.
Dust is collisionless, nonrelativistic matter, which obeys w = 0. Examples include ordinary
stars and galaxies, for which the pressure is negligible in comparison with the energy density.
Dust is also known as “matter”, and universes whose energy density is mostly due to dust
are known as matter-dominated. The energy density in matter falls off as
poxa®. (8.24)
This is simply interpreted as the decrease in the number density of particles as the universe
expands. (For dust the energy density is dominated by the rest energy, which is proportional
to the number density.) “Radiation” may be used to describe either actual electromagnetic
radiation, or massive particles moving at relative velocities sufficiently close to the speed of
light that they become indistinguishable from photons (at least as far as their equation of
state is concerned). Although radiation is a perfect fluid and thus has an energy-momentum
