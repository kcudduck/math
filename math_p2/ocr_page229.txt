A universe in which most of the energy density is in the form of radiation is known as
radiation-dominated. The energy density in radiation falls off as
poca . (8.28)
Thus, the energy density in radiation falls off slightly faster than that in matter; this is
because the number density of photons decreases in the same way as the number density of
nonrelativistic particles, but individual photons also lose energy as a~! as they redshift, as
we will see later. (Likewise, massive but relativistic particles will lose energy as they “slow
down” in comoving coordinates.) We believe that today the energy density of the universe
is dominated by matter, with pmat/praa ~ 105, However, in the past the universe was much
smaller, and the energy density in radiation would have dominated at very early times.
There is one other form of energy-momentum that is sometimes considered, namely that
of the vacuum itself. Introducing energy into the vacuum is equivalent to introducing a
cosmological constant. Einstein’s equations with a cosmological constant are
G = 81GT),, — Mgy (8.29)
which is clearly the same form as the equations with no cosmological constant but an energy-
momentum tensor for the vacuum,

T = ~5G0m (8.30)
This has the form of a perfect fluid with
A

P=-P=5a (8.31)
We therefore have w = —1, and the energy density is independent of a, which is what we
would expect for the energy density of the vacuum. Since the energy density in matter and
