1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 16
(A vector can have zero norm without being the zero vector.) You will notice that the
terminology is the same as that which we earlier used to classify the relationship between
two points in spacetime; it’s no accident, of course, and we will go into more detail later.

Another tensor is the Kronecker delta 0%, of type (1,1), which you already know the
components of. Related to this and the metric is the inverse metric 7**, a type (2,0)
tensor defined as the inverse of the metric:

7 Nup = Npn™ = 00 . (1.56)
In fact, as you can check, the inverse metric has exactly the same components as the metric
itself. (This is only true in flat space in Cartesian coordinates, and will fail to hold in more
general situations.) There is also the Levi-Civita tensor, a (0,4) tensor:
+1if pvpo is an even permutation of 0123
€vpo = { —1if prpo is an odd permutation of 0123 (1.57)
0 otherwise .
Here, a “permutation of 0123” is an ordering of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 which can be obtained
by starting with 0123 and exchanging two of the digits; an even permutation is obtained by
an even number of such exchanges, and an odd permutation is obtained by an odd number.
Thus, for example, €yza; = —1.

It is a remarkable property of the above tensors — the metric, the inverse metric, the
Kronecker delta, and the Levi-Civita tensor — that, even though they all transform according
to the tensor transformation law (1.51), their components remain unchanged in any Cartesian
coordinate system in flat spacetime. In some sense this makes them bad examples of tensors,
since most tensors do not have this property. In fact, even these tensors do not have this
property once we go to more general coordinate systems, with the single exception of the
Kronecker delta. This tensor has exactly the same components in any coordinate system
in any spacetime. This makes sense from the definition of a tensor as a linear map; the
Kronecker tensor can be thought of as the identity map from vectors to vectors (or from
dual vectors to dual vectors), which clearly must have the same components regardless of
coordinate system. The other tensors (the metric, its inverse, and the Levi-Civita tensor)
characterize the structure of spacetime, and all depend on the metric. We shall therefore
have to treat them more carefully when we drop our assumption of flat spacetime.

A more typical example of a tensor is the electromagnetic field strength tensor. We
all know that the electromagnetic fields are made up of the electric field vector E; and the
magnetic field vector B;. (Remember that we use Latin indices for spacelike components
1,2,3.) Actually these are only “vectors” under rotations in space, not under the full Lorentz
