radiation decreases as the universe expands, if there is a nonzero vacuum energy it tends
to win out over the long term (as long as the universe doesn’t start contracting). If this
happens, we say that the universe becomes vacuum-dominated.

We now turn to Einstein’s equations. Recall that they can be written in the form (4.45):

1
R,, = 871G (Tuv — §gWT> . (8.32)
The pv = 00 equation is ;

and the pv = ij equations give
a a k
—+2 <—> +2— =4rG(p—p) - (8.34)

(There is only one distinct equation from uv = ij, due to isotropy.) We can use (8.33) to
eliminate second derivatives in (8.34), and do a little cleaning up to obtain

Together these are known as the Friedmann equations, and metrics of the form (8.7)
which obey these equations define Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universes.

There is a bunch of terminology which is associated with the cosmological parameters,
and we will just introduce the basics here. The rate of expansion is characterized by the
Hubble parameter, )

; (37)
The value of the Hubble parameter at the present epoch is the Hubble constant, Hy. There
is currently a great deal of controversy about what its actual value is, with measurements
falling in the range of 40 to 90 km/sec/Mpc. (“Mpc” stands for “megaparsec”, which is
3 x 10%* cm.) Note that we have to divide @ by a to get a measurable quantity, since the
overall scale of a is irrelevant. There is also the deceleration parameter,
ad
4=-"7" (8.38)
which measures the rate of change of the rate of expansion.
Another useful quantity is the density parameter,
