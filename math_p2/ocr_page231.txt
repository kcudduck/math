where the critical density is defined by
2
o = o (8.40)
This quantity (which will generally change with time) is called the “critical” density because
the Friedmann equation (8.36) can be written
k
Q-1= T (8.41)
The sign of k is therefore determined by whether € is greater than, equal to, or less than
one. We have
pP<pait < N2<1 < k=-1 <  open
pP=Vpait < D=1 < k=0 flat
P> Paiy — 2>1 < k=+1 < closed.
The density parameter, then, tells us which of the three Robertson-Walker geometries de-
scribes our universe. Determining it observationally is an area of intense investigation.

It is possible to solve the Friedmann equations exactly in various simple cases, but it
is often more useful to know the qualitative behavior of various possibilities. Let us for
the moment set A = 0, and consider the behavior of universes filled with fluids of positive
energy (p > 0) and nonnegative pressure (p > 0). Then by (8.35) we must have @ < 0.
Since we know from observations of distant galaxies that the universe is expanding (a > 0),
this means that the universe is “decelerating.” This is what we should expect, since the
gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe works against the expansion. The fact
that the universe can only decelerate means that it must have been expanding even faster
in the past; if we trace the evolution backwards in time, we necessarily reach a singularity
at @ = 0. Notice that if & were exactly zero, a(t) would be a straight line, and the age of
the universe would be Hy'. Since d is actually negative, the universe must be somewhat
younger than that.

This singularity at @ = 0 is the Big Bang. It represents the creation of the universe
from a singular state, not explosion of matter into a pre-existing spacetime. It might be
hoped that the perfect symmetry of our FRW universes was responsible for this singularity,
but in fact it’s not true; the singularity theorems predict that any universe with p > 0 and
p > 0 must have begun at a singularity. Of course the energy density becomes arbitrarily
high as a — 0, and we don’t expect classical general relativity to be an accurate description
of nature in this regime; hopefully a consistent theory of quantum gravity will be able to fix
things up.
