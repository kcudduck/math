The future evolution is different for different values of k. For the open and flat cases,
k <0, (8.36) implies
8rG .
a? = /Tpaz + K| . (8.42)
The right hand side is strictly positive (since we are assuming p > 0), so @ never passes
through zero. Since we know that today a > 0, it must be positive for all time. Thus,
the open and flat universes expand forever — they are temporally as well as spatially open.
(Please keep in mind what assumptions go into this — namely, that there is a nonzero
positive energy density. Negative energy density universes do not have to expand forever,
even if they are “open”.)
How fast do these universes keep expanding? Consider the quantity pa® (which is constant
in matter-dominated universes). By the conservation of energy equation (8.20) we have
d, 4 3 ( a
—(pa®) = a +3 7)
7P) p+3p
= —3pa*a . (8.43)
The right hand side is either zero or negative; therefore
4 pa?) <0 (8.44)
g pa) <0 .
This implies in turn that pa? must go to zero in an ever-expanding universe, where a — co.
Thus (8.42) tells us that
a® — k| . (8.45)
(Remember that this is true for k& < 0.) Thus, for k¥ = —1 the expansion approaches the
limiting value @ — 1, while for & = 0 the universe keeps expanding, but more and more
slowly.
