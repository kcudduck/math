For the closed universes (k = +1), (8.36) becomes
. 8nG
i = Tr—/)a,z -1. (8.46)
3
The argument that pa®> — 0 as a — oo still applies; but in that case (8.46) would be-
come negative, which can’t happen. Therefore the universe does not expand indefinitely; a
possesses an upper bound ap,,. As a approaches ayax, (8.35) implies
drG
i — 7%(;; + 3)max < 0 . (8.47)
Thus d is finite and negative at this point, so a reaches an.x and starts decreasing, whereupon
(since @ < 0) it will inevitably continue to contract to zero — the Big Crunch. Thus, the
closed universes (again, under our assumptions of positive p and nonnegative p) are closed
in time as well as space.

We will now list some of the exact solutions corresponding to only one type of energy
density. For dust-only universes (p = 0), it is convenient to define a development angle
¢(t), rather than using ¢ as a parameter directly. The solutions are then, for open universes,
a:(,%(cosh(/bfl) (k= —1) (8.48)
t = 5(sinh ¢ — ) ’ ’
for flat universes,
