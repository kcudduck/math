8 COSMOLOGY 227
where we have defined 8rC
C= 7TTpag = constant . (8.51)
For universes filled with nothing but radiation, p = %p, we have once again open universes,
L2 1/2
a=VvC||1+—]| -1 k=-1), 8.52
v {( =) } (k= -1). 852)
flat universes,
a=(@4CH4 2 (k=0), (8.53)
and closed universes,
f\? 1/2
a=VvC|l-|1-— k=+1), 8.54
v { (1- ) } (=41, (550
where this time we defined 8rC
C' = Wszﬁ = constant . (8.55)
You can check for yourselves that these exact solutions have the properties we argued would
hold in general.

For universes which are empty save for the cosmological constant, either p or p will be
negative, in violation of the assumptions we used earlier to derive the general behavior of
a(t). In this case the connection between open/closed and expands forever/recollapses is
lost. We begin by considering A < 0. In this case Q is negative, and from (8.41) this can
only happen if £ = —1. The solution in this case is

-3 —A
a:‘/Tsin (1/315) . (8.56)
There is also an open (k = —1) solution for A > 0, given by
3 A
a= \/;sinh (\/?L‘) . (8.57)
A flat vacuum-dominated universe must have A > 0, and the solution is
A
a o< exp (i\/;t> , (8.58)
while the closed universe must also have A > 0, and satisfies
3 A
a= \/;Cosh (\/;t> . (8.59)
