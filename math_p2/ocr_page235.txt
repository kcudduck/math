These solutions are a little misleading. In fact the three solutions for A > 0 — (8.57), (8.58),
and (8.59) — all represent the same spacetime, just in different coordinates. This spacetime,
known as de Sitter space, is actually maximally symmetric as a spacetime. (See Hawking
and Ellis for details.) The A < 0 solution (8.56) is also maximally symmetric, and is known
as anti-de Sitter space.

It is clear that we would like to observationally determine a number of quantities to decide
which of the FRW models corresponds to our universe. Obviously we would like to determine
Hy, since that is related to the age of the universe. (For a purely matter-dominated, k = 0
universe, (8.49) implies that the age is 2/(3Hy). Other possibilities would predict similar
relations.) We would also like to know €, which determines k through (8.41). Given the
definition (8.39) of €, this means we want to know both Hy and pg. Unfortunately both
quantities are hard to measure accurately, especially p. But notice that the deceleration
parameter ¢ can be related to Q using (8.35):

Therefore, if we think we know what w is (i.e., what kind of stuff the universe is made of),
we can determine © by measuring ¢. (Unfortunately we are not completely confident that
we know w, and ¢ is itself hard to measure. But people are trying.)

To understand how these quantities might conceivably be measured, let’s consider geo-
desic motion in an FRW universe. There are a number of spacelike Killing vectors, but no
timelike Killing vector to give us a notion of conserved energy. There is, however, a Killing
tensor. If U* = (1,0,0,0) is the four-velocity of comoving observers, then the tensor

K;w = (1’2<g;w + U;:Uu) (861)
satisfies V(, K ,,) = 0 (as you can check), and is therefore a Killing tensor. This means that
if a particle has four-velocity V# = da*/d\, the quantity

K? = K, V'V = a®[V,V* + (U, V") (8.62)

will be a constant along geodesics. Let’s think about this, first for massive particles. Then
we will have V,V# = —1, or

(VO =1+|V]>, (8.63)
