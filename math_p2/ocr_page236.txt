The particle therefore “slows down” with respect to the comoving coordinates as the universe
expands. In fact this is an actual slowing down, in the sense that a gas of particles with
initially high relative velocities will cool down as the universe expands.
A similar thing happens to null geodesics. In this case V,V# = 0, and (8.62) implies

But the frequency of the photon as measured by a comoving observer is w = —U,V#. The
frequency of the photon emitted with frequency w; will therefore be observed with a lower
frequency wy as the universe expands:

Cosmologists like to speak of this in terms of the redshift z between the two events, defined
by the fractional change in wavelength:

w (5.67)
Notice that this redshift is not the same as the conventional Doppler effect; it is the expansion
of space, not the relative velocities of the observer and emitter, which leads to the redshift.
The redshift is something we can measure; we know the rest-frame wavelengths of various
spectral lines in the radiation from distant galaxies, so we can tell how much their wavelengths
have changed along the path from time ¢, when they were emitted to time ¢, when they were
observed. We therefore know the ratio of the scale factors at these two times. But we don’t
know the times themselves; the photons are not clever enough to tell us how much coordinate
time has elapsed on their journey. We have to work harder to extract this information.
Roughly speaking, since a photon moves at the speed of light its travel time should simply
be its distance. But what is the “distance” of a far away galaxy in an expanding universe?
The comoving distance is not especially useful, since it is not measurable, and furthermore
because the galaxies need not be comoving in general. Instead we can define the luminosity
distance as I

where L is the absolute luminosity of the source and F' is the flux measured by the observer
(the energy per unit time per unit area of some detector). The definition comes from the
