fact that in flat space, for a source at distance d the flux over the luminosity is just one
over the area of a sphere centered around the source, F//L = 1/A(d) = 1/4wd® In an FRW
universe, however, the flux will be diluted. Conservation of photons tells us that the total
number of photons emitted by the source will eventually pass through a sphere at comoving
distance r from the emitter. Such a sphere is at a physical distance d = agr, where ag is
the scale factor when the photons are observed. But the flux is diluted by two additional
effects: the individual photons redshift by a factor (1 + z), and the photons hit the sphere
less frequently, since two photons emitted a time 0t apart will be measured at a time (1+z)dt
apart. Therefore we will have

The luminosity distance dy, is something we might hope to measure, since there are some
astrophysical sources whose absolute luminosities are known (“standard candles”). But 7 is
not observable, so we have to remove that from our equation. On a null geodesic (chosen to
be radial for convenience) we have

For galaxies not too far away, we can expand the scale factor in a Taylor series about its
present value:
atr) = ao + (@)o(tr = to) + 5 (@)o(tr — )+ ... . (8.73)
We can then expand both sides of (8.72) to find

Now remembering (8.67), the expansion (8.73) is the same as

For small Hy(t; — to) this can be inverted to yield
