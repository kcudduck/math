Substituting this back again into (8.74) gives

Finally, using this in (8.70) yields Hubble’s Law:

Therefore, measurement of the luminosity distances and redshifts of a sufficient number of
galaxies allows us to determine Hy and ¢, and therefore takes us a long way to deciding
what kind of FRW universe we live in. The observations themselves are extremely difficult,
and the values of these parameters in the real world are still hotly contested. Over the next
decade or so a variety of new strategies and more precise application of old strategies could
very well answer these questions once and for all.
