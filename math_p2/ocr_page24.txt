From this point of view it is easy to transform the electromagnetic fields in one reference
frame to those in another, by application of (1.51). The unifying power of the tensor formal-
ism is evident: rather than a collection of two vectors whose relationship and transformation
properties are rather mysterious, we have a single tensor field to describe all of electromag-
netism. (On the other hand, don’t get carried away; sometimes it’s more convenient to work
in a single coordinate system using the electric and magnetic field vectors.)

With some examples in hand we can now be a little more systematic about some prop-
erties of tensors. First consider the operation of contraction, which turns a (k,!) tensor
into a (k — 1,1 — 1) tensor. Contraction proceeds by summing over one upper and one lower
index:

Skl =THP,, . (1.59)
You can check that the result is a well-defined tensor. Of course it is only permissible to
contract an upper index with a lower index (as opposed to two indices of the same type).
Note also that the order of the indices matters, so that you can get different tensors by
contracting in different ways; thus,

TP, # T, (1.60)
in general.

The metric and inverse metric can be used to raise and lower indices on tensors. That
is, given a tensor T“’SV,;, we can use the metric to define new tensors which we choose to
denote by the same letter 7"

TR s = 7/IWTGH”( 5,

Tuﬁ'yri = nuaTnB'yé )

T, = 7/;,(!7/,,/,7/‘”7/”‘5T‘1375 s (1.61)
and so forth. Notice that raising and lowering does not change the position of an index
relative to other indices, and also that “free” indices (which are not summed over) must be
the same on both sides of an equation, while “dummy” indices (which are summed over)
only appear on one side. As an example, we can turn vectors and dual vectors into each
other by raising and lowering indices:

Vi = nu V"
wh = nw, . (1.62)
