1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 18
This explains why the gradient in three-dimensional flat Euclidean space is usually thought
of as an ordinary vector, even though we have seen that it arises as a dual vector; in Euclidean
space (where the metric is diagonal with all entries +1) a dual vector is turned into a vector
with precisely the same components when we raise its index. You may then wonder why we
have belabored the distinction at all. One simple reason, of course, is that in a Lorentzian
spacetime the components are not equal:
wh = (—wo, w1, wa,w3) . (1.63)
In a curved spacetime, where the form of the metric is generally more complicated, the dif-
ference is rather more dramatic. But there is a deeper reason, namely that tensors generally
have a “natural” definition which is independent of the metric. Even though we will always
have a metric available, it is helpful to be aware of the logical status of each mathematical
object we introduce. The gradient, and its action on vectors, is perfectly well defined re-
gardless of any metric, whereas the “gradient with upper indices” is not. (As an example,
we will eventually want to take variations of functionals with respect to the metric, and will
therefore have to know exactly how the functional depends on the metric, something that is
easily obscured by the index notation.)
Continuing our compilation of tensor jargon, we refer to a tensor as symmetric in any
of its indices if it is unchanged under exchange of those indices. Thus, if
Suvp = Supp (1.64)
we say that S, is symmetric in its first two indices, while if
Suvp = Supw = Spp = Svpp = Svpu = Spup 5 (1.65)
we say that S,,, is symmetric in all three of its indices. Similarly, a tensor is antisym-
metric (or “skew-symmetric”) in any of its indices if it changes sign when those indices are
exchanged; thus,
App = —Apy (1.66)
means that A,,, is antisymmetric in its first and third indices (or just “antisymmetric in p
and p”). If a tensor is (anti-) symmetric in all of its indices, we refer to it as simply (anti-)
symmetric (sometimes with the redundant modifier “completely”). As examples, the metric
N and the inverse metric n*” are symmetric, while the Levi-Civita tensor €,,,, and the
electromagnetic field strength tensor F),, are antisymmetric. (Check for yourself that if you
raise or lower a set of indices which are symmetric or antisymmetric, they remain that way.)
Notice that it makes no sense to exchange upper and lower indices with each other, so don’t
succumb to the temptation to think of the Kronecker delta d§ as symmetric. On the other
hand, the fact that lowering an index on ¢§ gives a symmetric tensor (in fact, the metric)
