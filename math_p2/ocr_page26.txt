means that the order of indices doesn’t really matter, which is why we don’t keep track index
placement for this one tensor.

Given any tensor, we can symmetrize (or antisymmetrize) any number of its upper or
lower indices. To symmetrize, we take the sum of all permutations of the relevant indices
and divide by the number of terms:

Tipspin)e’ = ] (T pigepinp” + sum over permutations of indices iy - - i) , (1.67)
while antisymmetrization comes from the alternating sum:
T ”*1T 7 + alternati ‘mutati f indi
lpapinlp” = E( Yipizpnp”  alternating sum over permutations of indices i1 -« - fin) .
(1.68)
By “alternating sum” we mean that permutations which are the result of an odd number of
exchanges are given a minus sign, thus:
1
ﬂyup]a = 6 (T}u/p(r - T‘w}ua + T‘p;wa - Tl/;:;)(r + Tl/;);w - T‘pl/;w) . (169)
Notice that round/square brackets denote symmetrization/antisymmetrization. Further-
more, we may sometimes want to (anti-) symmetrize indices which are not next to each
other, in which case we use vertical bars to denote indices not included in the sum:
1
T(;L\V\p) = 2 (Twp + Tp»u) . (1-70)
Finally, some people use a convention in which the factor of 1/n! is omitted. The one used
here is a good one, since (for example) a symmetric tensor satisfies
Spiropin = S(ureopn) (1.71)
and likewise for antisymmetric tensors.

We have been very careful so far to distinguish clearly between things that are always
true (on a manifold with arbitrary metric) and things which are only true in Minkowski
space in Cartesian coordinates. One of the most important distinctions arises with partial
derivatives. If we are working in flat spacetime with Cartesian coordinates, then the partial
derivative of a (k,[) tensor is a (k, I + 1) tensor; that is,

T" = 0. R", (1.72)
transforms properly under Lorentz transformations. However, this will no longer be true
in more general spacetimes, and we will have to define a “covariant derivative” to take the
place of the partial derivative. Nevertheless, we can still use the fact that partial derivatives
