1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 20
give us tensor in this special case, as long as we keep our wits about us. (The one exception
to this warning is the partial derivative of a scalar, d,¢, which is a perfectly good tensor
[the gradient] in any spacetime.)

We have now accumulated enough tensor know-how to illustrate some of these concepts
using actual physics. Specifically, we will examine Maxwell’s equations of electrodynam-
ics. In 19" -century notation, these are

VxB-9E = 4nJ
V-E = 4mp
VxE+0B = 0
V-B = 0. (1.73)
Here, E and B are the electric and magnetic field 3-vectors, J is the current, p is the
charge density, and Vx and V- are the conventional curl and divergence. These equations
are invariant under Lorentz transformations, of course; that’s how the whole business got
started. But they don’t look obviously invariant; our tensor notation can fix that. Let’s
begin by writing these equations in just a slightly different notation,
OE = ArJ°
B = 0. (1.74)
In these expressions, spatial indices have been raised and lowered with abandon, without
any attempt to keep straight where the metric appears. This is because d;; is the metric on
flat 3-space, with 6% its inverse (they are equal as matrices). We can therefore raise and
lower indices at will, since the components don’t change. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional
Levi-Civita tensor €¢7* is defined just as the four-dimensional one, although with one fewer
index. We have replaced the charge density by JO; this is legitimate because the density and
current together form the current 4-vector, J* = (p, J1, J?, J3).

From these expressions, and the definition (1.58) of the field strength tensor F,, it is
easy to get a completely tensorial 20'"-century version of Maxwell’s equations. Begin by
noting that we can express the field strength with upper indices as

Y g
F9 = *B, . (1.75)
(To check this, note for example that FO = n®pt Fy) and F'2 = €!2B;.) Then the first two
equations in (1.74) become
0;F7 — 9oF% = 4rmJ’
