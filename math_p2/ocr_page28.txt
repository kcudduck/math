1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 21
OHFY = 4rJ°. (1.76)
Using the antisymmetry of F*¥, we see that these may be combined into the single tensor
equation
O F"™ = 4mJ" . (1.77)
A similar line of reasoning, which is left as an exercise to you, reveals that the third and
fourth equations in (1.74) can be written
OuFux =0. (1.78)
The four traditional Maxwell equations are thus replaced by two, thus demonstrating the
economy of tensor notation. More importantly, however, both sides of equations (1.77) and
(1.78) manifestly transform as tensors; therefore, if they are true in one inertial frame, they
must be true in any Lorentz-transformed frame. This is why tensors are so useful in relativity
— we often want to express relationships without recourse to any reference frame, and it is
necessary that the quantities on each side of an equation transform in the same way under
change of coordinates. As a matter of jargon, we will sometimes refer to quantities which
are written in terms of tensors as covariant (which has nothing to do with “covariant”
as opposed to “contravariant”). Thus, we say that (1.77) and (1.78) together serve as the
covariant form of Maxwell’s equations, while (1.73) or (1.74) are non-covariant.

Let us now introduce a special class of tensors, known as differential forms (or just
“forms”). A differential p-form is a (0,p) tensor which is completely antisymmetric. Thus,
scalars are automatically O-forms, and dual vectors are automatically one-forms (thus ex-
plaining this terminology from a while back). We also have the 2-form F},, and the 4-form
€uvpo- The space of all p-forms is denoted AP, and the space of all p-form fields over a mani-
fold M is denoted AP(M). A semi-straightforward exercise in combinatorics reveals that the
number of linearly independent p-forms on an n-dimensional vector space is n!/(p!(n — p)!).
So at a point on a 4-dimensional spacetime there is one linearly independent 0-form, four
1-forms, six 2-forms, four 3-forms, and one 4-form. There are no p-forms for p > n, since all
of the components will automatically be zero by antisymmetry.

Why should we care about differential forms? This is a hard question to answer without
some more work, but the basic idea is that forms can be both differentiated and integrated,
without the help of any additional geometric structure. We will delay integration theory
until later, but see how to differentiate forms shortly.

Given a p-form A and a ¢-form B, we can form a (p + ¢)-form known as the wedge
product A A B by taking the antisymmetrized tensor product:
