1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 22
Thus, for example, the wedge product of two 1-forms is
(ANB)u =2AuB,)=A,B, — A,B, . (1.80)
Note that
ANB=(-1MBAA, (1.81)
so you can alter the order of a wedge product if you are careful with signs.
The exterior derivative “d” allows us to differentiate p-form fields to obtain (p+1)-form
fields. It is defined as an appropriately normalized antisymmetric partial derivative:
(dA)m~-up+1 =+ 1)8[}11Al‘2"‘l"r+1] . (1.82)
The simplest example is the gradient, which is the exterior derivative of a 1-form:
The reason why the exterior derivative deserves special attention is that it is a tensor, even in
curved spacetimes, unlike its cousin the partial derivative. Since we haven’t studied curved
spaces yet, we cannot prove this, but (1.82) defines an honest tensor no matter what the
metric and coordinates are.
Another interesting fact about exterior differentiation is that, for any form A,
d(d4) =0, (1.84)
which is often written d?> = 0. This identity is a consequence of the definition of d and the
fact that partial derivatives commute, 0,05 = 930, (acting on anything). This leads us to
the following mathematical aside, just for fun. We define a p-form A to be closed if dA = 0,
and exact if A = dB for some (p—1)-form B. Obviously, all exact forms are closed, but the
converse is not necessarily true. On a manifold M, closed p-forms comprise a vector space
ZP(M), and exact forms comprise a vector space BP(M). Define a new vector space as the
closed forms modulo the exact forms:
ZP(M)
HP (M) = /. 1.85
(M) = 5 (1.85)
This is known as the pth de Rham cohomology vector space, and depends only on the
topology of the manifold M. (Minkowski space is topologically equivalent to R?, which is
uninteresting, so that all of the H?(M) vanish for p > 0; for p = 0 we have H'(M) = R.
Therefore in Minkowski space all closed forms are exact except for zero-forms; zero-forms
can’t be exact since there are no —1-forms for them to be the exterior derivative of.) It is
striking that information about the topology can be extracted in this way, which essentially
involves the solutions to differential equations. The dimension b, of the space H?(M) is
