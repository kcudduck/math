Cohomology theory is the basis for much of modern differential topology.

Moving back to reality, the final operation on differential forms we will introduce is
Hodge duality. We define the “Hodge star operator” on an n-dimensional manifold as a
map from p-forms to (n — p)-forms,

mapping A to “A dual”. Unlike our other operations on forms, the Hodge dual does depend
on the metric of the manifold (which should be obvious, since we had to raise some indices
on the Levi-Civita tensor in order to define (1.87)). Applying the Hodge star twice returns

either plus or minus the original form:
w %A = (=1)FPP 4 (1.88)
where s is the number of minus signs in the eigenvalues of the metric (for Minkowski space,

Two facts on the Hodge dual: First, “duality” in the sense of Hodge is different than the
relationship between vectors and dual vectors, although both can be thought of as the space
of linear maps from the original space to R. Notice that the dimensionality of the space of
(n — p)-forms is equal to that of the space of p-forms, so this has at least a chance of being
true. In the case of forms, the linear map defined by an (n — p)-form acting on a p-form is
given by the dual of the wedge product of the two forms. Thus, if A®P) is an (n — p)-form
and B® is a p-form at some point in spacetime, we have

The second fact concerns differential forms in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The Hodge
dual of the wedge product of two 1-forms gives another 1-form:

* (UNAV); =e/*U Vi, (1.90)
(All of the prefactors cancel.) Since 1-forms in Euclidean space are just like vectors, we have
a map from two vectors to a single vector. You should convince yourself that this is just the
conventional cross product, and that the appearance of the Levi-Civita tensor explains why
the cross product changes sign under parity (interchange of two coordinates, or equivalently
basis vectors). This is why the cross product only exists in three dimensions — because only
