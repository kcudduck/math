1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 24
in three dimensions do we have an interesting map from two dual vectors to a third dual
vector. If you wanted to you could define a map from n — 1 one-forms to a single one-form,
but I'm not sure it would be of any use.

Electrodynamics provides an especially compelling example of the use of differential
forms. From the definition of the exterior derivative, it is clear that equation (1.78) can
be concisely expressed as closure of the two-form F,,:

dF =0. (1.91)
Does this mean that F' is also exact? Yes; as we’ve noted, Minkowski space is topologically
trivial, so all closed forms are exact. There must therefore be a one-form A, such that

F=dA. (1.92)
This one-form is the familiar vector potential of electromagnetism, with the 0 component
given by the scalar potential, Ay = ¢. If one starts from the view that the A, is the
fundamental field of electromagnetism, then (1.91) follows as an identity (as opposed to a
dynamical law, an equation of motion). Gauge invariance is expressed by the observation
that the theory is invariant under A — A + d\ for some scalar (zero-form) A, and this is
also immediate from the relation (1.92). The other one of Maxwell’s equations, (1.77), can
be expressed as an equation between three-forms:

d(xF) = 4dn(xJ) , (1.93)

where the current one-form J is just the current four-vector with index lowered. Filling in
the details is left for you to do.

As an intriguing aside, Hodge duality is the basis for one of the hottest topics in theoretical
physics today. It’s hard not to notice that the equations (1.91) and (1.93) look very similar.
Indeed, if we set J, = 0, the equations are invariant under the “duality transformations”

F —xF

*F — —F . (1.94)
We therefore say that the vacuum Maxwell’s equations are duality invariant, while the invari-
ance is spoiled in the presence of charges. We might imagine that magnetic as well as electric
monopoles existed in nature; then we could add a magnetic current term 4 (x.Jys) to the
right hand side of (1.91), and the equations would be invariant under duality transformations
plus the additional replacement J < Jy;. (Of course a nonzero right hand side to (1.91) is
inconsistent with F' = dA, so this idea only works if A, is not a fundamental variable.) Long
ago Dirac considered the idea of magnetic monopoles and showed that a necessary condition
for their existence is that the fundamental monopole charge be inversely proportional to
