1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 25
the fundamental electric charge. Now, the fundamental electric charge is a small number;
electrodynamics is “weakly coupled”; which is why perturbation theory is so remarkably
successful in quantum electrodynamics (QED). But Dirac’s condition on magnetic charges
implies that a duality transformation takes a theory of weakly coupled electric charges to a
theory of strongly coupled magnetic monopoles (and vice-versa). Unfortunately monopoles
don’t exist (as far as we know), so these ideas aren’t directly applicable to electromagnetism;
but there are some theories (such as supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theories) for which
it has been long conjectured that some sort of duality symmetry may exist. If it did, we
would have the opportunity to analyze a theory which looked strongly coupled (and therefore
hard to solve) by looking at the weakly coupled dual version. Recently work by Seiberg and
Witten and others has provided very strong evidence that this is exactly what happens in
certain theories. The hope is that these techniques will allow us to explore various phenom-
ena which we know exist in strongly coupled quantum field theories, such as confinement of
quarks in hadrons.

We’ve now gone over essentially everything there is to know about the care and feeding of
tensors. In the next section we will look more carefully at the rigorous definitions of manifolds
and tensors, but the basic mechanics have been pretty well covered. Before jumping to more
abstract mathematics, let’s review how physics works in Minkowski spacetime.

Start with the worldline of a single particle. This is specified by a map R — M, where
M is the manifold representing spacetime; we usually think of the path as a parameterized
curve 2#(A). As mentioned earlier, the tangent vector to this path is da#/d\ (note that it
depends on the parameterization). An object of primary interest is the norm of the tangent
vector, which serves to characterize the path; if the tangent vector is timelike/null/spacelike
at some parameter value A, we say that the path is timelike/null/spacelike at that point. This
explains why the same words are used to classify vectors in the tangent space and intervals
between two points — because a straight line connecting, say, two timelike separated points
will itself be timelike at every point along the path.

Nevertheless, it’s important to be aware of the sleight of hand which is being pulled here.
The metric, as a (0,2) tensor, is a machine which acts on two vectors (or two copies of the
same vector) to produce a number. It is therefore very natural to classify tangent vectors
according to the sign of their norm. But the interval between two points isn’t something
quite so natural; it depends on a specific choice of path (a “straight line”) which connects
the points, and this choice in turn depends on the fact that spacetime is flat (which allows
a unique choice of straight line between the points). A more natural object is the line
element, or infinitesimal interval:

ds* = ndatdz’ . (1.95)
From this definition it is tempting to take the square root and integrate along a path to
obtain a finite interval. But since ds? need not be positive, we define different procedures
