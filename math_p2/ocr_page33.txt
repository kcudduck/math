which will be positive. Of course we may consider paths that are timelike in some places and
spacelike in others, but fortunately it is seldom necessary since the paths of physical particles
never change their character (massive particles move on timelike paths, massless particles
move on null paths). Furthermore, the phrase “proper time” is especially appropriate, since
T actually measures the time elapsed on a physical clock carried along the path. This point of
view makes the “twin paradox” and similar puzzles very clear; two worldlines, not necessarily
straight, which intersect at two different events in spacetime will have proper times measured
by the integral (1.97) along the appropriate paths, and these two numbers will in general be
different even if the people travelling along them were born at the same time.

Let’s move from the consideration of paths in general to the paths of massive particles
(which will always be timelike). Since the proper time is measured by a clock travelling on
a timelike worldline, it is convenient to use 7 as the parameter along the path. That is, we
use (1.97) to compute 7(\), which (if A is a good parameter in the first place) we can invert
to obtain A(7), after which we can think of the path as z#(7). The tangent vector in this
