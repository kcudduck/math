Since dr? = —n,, dz"dz”, the four-velocity is automatically normalized:
NuU'U” = =1 . (1.99)
(It will always be negative, since we are only defining it for timelike trajectories. You could
define an analogous vector for spacelike paths as well; null paths give some extra problems
since the norm is zero.) In the rest frame of a particle, its four-velocity has components
U* = (1,0,0,0).
A related vector is the energy-momentum four-vector, defined by
P =mU" | (1.100)
where m is the mass of the particle. The mass is a fixed quantity independent of inertial
frame; what you may be used to thinking of as the “rest mass.” It turns out to be much
more convenient to take this as the mass once and for all, rather than thinking of mass as
depending on velocity. The energy of a particle is simply p°, the timelike component of its
energy-momentum vector. Since it’s only one component of a four-vector, it is not invariant
under Lorentz transformations; that’s to be expected, however, since the energy of a particle
at rest is not the same as that of the same particle in motion. In the particle’s rest frame we
have p” = m; recalling that we have set ¢ = 1, we find that we have found the equation that
made Einstein a celebrity, £ = mc®. (The field equations of general relativity are actually
much more important than this one, but “R,,, — %ng = 8rG1T,," doesn’t elicit the visceral
reaction that you get from “E = mc?”.) In a moving frame we can find the components of
p* by performing a Lorentz transformation; for a particle moving with (three-) velocity v
along the x axis we have
" = (ym,vym,0,0) , (1.101)
where v = 1/v/1 =% For small v, this gives p” = m + $mv? (what we usually think of
as rest energy plus kinetic energy) and p' = mv (what we usually think of as [Newtonian]
momentum). So the energy-momentum vector lives up to its name.

The centerpiece of pre-relativity physics is Newton’s 2nd Law, or f = ma = dp/dt. An
analogous equation should hold in SR, and the requirement that it be tensorial leads us
directly to introduce a force four-vector f* satisfying

The simplest example of a force in Newtonian physics is the force due to gravity. In relativity,
however, gravity is not described by a force, but rather by the curvature of spacetime itself.
