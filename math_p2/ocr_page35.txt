1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 28
Instead, let us consider electromagnetism. The three-dimensional Lorentz force is given
by f = ¢(E + v x B), where ¢ is the charge on the particle. We would like a tensorial
generalization of this equation. There turns out to be a unique answer:

= qU Ry . (1.103)
You can check for yourself that this reduces to the Newtonian version in the limit of small
velocities. Notice how the requirement that the equation be tensorial, which is one way of
guaranteeing Lorentz invariance, severely restricted the possible expressions we could get.
This is an example of a very general phenomenon, in which a small number of an apparently
endless variety of possible physical laws are picked out by the demands of symmetry.

Although p* provides a complete description of the energy and momentum of a particle,
for extended systems it is necessary to go further and define the energy-momentum tensor
(sometimes called the stress-energy tensor), 7. This is a symmetric (2,0) tensor which tells
us all we need to know about the energy-like aspects of a system: energy density, pressure,
stress, and so forth. A general definition of 7" is “the flux of four-momentum p* across a
surface of constant z¥”. To make this more concrete, let’s consider the very general category
of matter which may be characterized as a fluid — a continuum of matter described by
macroscopic quantities such as temperature, pressure, entropy, viscosity, etc. In fact this
definition is so general that it is of little use. In general relativity essentially all interesting
types of matter can be thought of as perfect fluids, from stars to electromagnetic fields to
the entire universe. Schutz defines a perfect fluid to be one with no heat conduction and no
viscosity, while Weinberg defines it as a fluid which looks isotropic in its rest frame; these
two viewpoints turn out to be equivalent. Operationally, you should think of a perfect fluid
as one which may be completely characterized by its pressure and density.

To understand perfect fluids, let’s start with the even simpler example of dust. Dust
is defined as a collection of particles at rest with respect to each other, or alternatively
as a perfect fluid with zero pressure. Since the particles all have an equal velocity in any
fixed inertial frame, we can imagine a “four-velocity field” U*(z) defined all over spacetime.
(Indeed, its components are the same at each point.) Define the number-flux four-vector
to be

Nt =nU" | (1.104)
where n is the number density of the particles as measured in their rest frame. Then N°
is the number density of particles as measured in any other frame, while N is the flux of
particles in the 2 direction. Let’s now imagine that each of the particles have the same mass
m. Then in the rest frame the energy density of the dust is given by

p=nm . (1.105)
