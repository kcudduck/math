1 SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND FLAT SPACETIME 30

As further examples, let’s consider the energy-momentum tensors of electromagnetism
and scalar field theory. Without any explanation at all, these are given by

R VSO R
tm = (FHAEY ) 1" FYFy\), (1.111)
and 1
T e = 107 060 ) — 57/“”(7/A”3A(b&,(b +m2¢?) . (1.112)
You can check for yourself that, for example, 7% in each case is equal to what you would
expect the energy density to be.

Besides being symmetric, 7" has the even more important property of being conserved.
In this context, conservation is expressed as the vanishing of the “divergence”:

0,T* =0. (1.113)
This is a set of four equations, one for each value of v. The v = 0 equation corresponds to
conservation of energy, while 9, T"% = 0 expresses conservation of the k™" component of the
momentum. We are not going to prove this in general; the proof follows for any individual
source of matter from the equations of motion obeyed by that kind of matter. In fact, one
way to define 7" would be “a (2,0) tensor with units of energy per volume, which is con-
served.” You can prove conservation of the energy-momentum tensor for electromagnetism,
for example, by taking the divergence of (1.111) and using Maxwell’s equations as previously
discussed.

A final aside: we have already mentioned that in general relativity gravitation does not
count as a “force.” As a related point, the gravitational field also does not have an energy-
momentum tensor. In fact it is very hard to come up with a sensible local expression for the
energy of a gravitational field; a number of suggestions have been made, but they all have
their drawbacks. Although there is no “correct” answer, it is an important issue from the
point of view of asking seemingly reasonable questions such as “What is the energy emitted
per second from a binary pulsar as the result of gravitational radiation?”
