2 Manifolds

After the invention of special relativity, Einstein tried for a number of years to invent a
Lorentz-invariant theory of gravity, without success. His eventual breakthrough was to
replace Minkowski spacetime with a curved spacetime, where the curvature was created by
(and reacted back on) energy and momentum. Before we explore how this happens, we have
to learn a bit about the mathematics of curved spaces. First we will take a look at manifolds
in general, and then in the next section study curvature. In the interest of generality we will
usually work in n dimensions, although you are permitted to take n = 4 if you like.

A manifold (or sometimes “differentiable manifold”) is one of the most fundamental
concepts in mathematics and physics. We are all aware of the properties of n-dimensional
Euclidean space, R", the set of n-tuples (2!,...,2"). The notion of a manifold captures the
idea of a space which may be curved and have a complicated topology, but in local regions
looks just like R™. (Here by “looks like” we do not mean that the metric is the same, but only
basic notions of analysis like open sets, functions, and coordinates.) The entire manifold is
constructed by smoothly sewing together these local regions. Examples of manifolds include:

e R itself, including the line (R), the plane (R?), and so on. This should be obvious,
since R" looks like R™ not only locally but globally.

e The n-sphere, S™. This can be defined as the locus of all points some fixed distance
from the origin in R"*!. The circle is of course S', and the two-sphere S? will be one
of our favorite examples of a manifold.

e The n-torus 7™ results from taking an n-dimensional cube and identifying opposite
sides. Thus 72 is the traditional surface of a doughnut.
