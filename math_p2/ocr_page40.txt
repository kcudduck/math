The most elementary notion is that of a map between two sets. (We assume you know
what a set is.) Given two sets M and N, amap ¢ : M — N is a relationship which assigns, to
each element of M, exactly one element of N. A map is therefore just a simple generalization
of a function. The canonical picture of a map looks like this:

M
[E—
N

Given two maps ¢ : A — B and ¢ : B — C, we define the composition ) o¢: A — C
by the operation (¢ o ¢)(a) = ¥(¢(a)). So a € A, ¢(a) € B, and thus (¢ o ¢)(a) € C. The
order in which the maps are written makes sense, since the one on the right acts first. In
pictures:

é
A \ / C
B

A map ¢ is called one-to-one (or “injective”) if each element of N has at most one
element of M mapped into it, and onto (or “surjective”) if each element of N has at least
one element of M mapped into it. (If you think about it, a better name for “one-to-one”
would be “two-to-two”.) Consider a function ¢ : R — R. Then ¢(z) = ¢* is one-to-one, but
not onto; ¢(z) = 2® — x is onto, but not one-to-one; ¢(r) = z* is both; and ¢(z) = 22 is
neither.

The set M is known as the domain of the map ¢, and the set of points in N which M
gets mapped into is called the image of ¢. For some subset U C N, the set of elements of
M which get mapped to U is called the preimage of U under ¢, or ¢~1(U). A map which is
