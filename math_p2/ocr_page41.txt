both one-to-one and onto is known as invertible (or “bijective”). In this case we can define
the inverse map ¢! : N — M by (¢! o ¢)(a) = a. (Note that the same symbol ¢! is
used for both the preimage and the inverse map, even though the former is always defined
and the latter is only defined in some special cases.) Thus:

The notion of continuity of a map between topological spaces (and thus manifolds) is
actually a very subtle one, the precise formulation of which we won’t really need. However
the intuitive notions of continuity and differentiability of maps ¢ : R™ — R™ between
Euclidean spaces are useful. A map from R™ to R" takes an m-tuple (2!, 22,... 2™) to an
n-tuple (y,9% ..., y"), and can therefore be thought of as a collection of n functions ¢’ of
