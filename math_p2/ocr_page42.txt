Yy = ¢n(at 2t am) .
We will refer to any one of these functions as C? if it is continuous and p-times differentiable,
and refer to the entire map ¢ : R™ — R" as CP? if each of its component functions are at
least C?. Thus a C° map is continuous but not necessarily differentiable, while a C* map
is continuous and can be differentiated as many times as you like. C* maps are sometimes
called smooth. We will call two sets M and N diffeomorphic if there exists a C*° map
¢: M — N with a C*> inverse ¢! : N — M; the map ¢ is then called a diffeomorphism.

Aside: The notion of two spaces being diffeomorphic only applies to manifolds, where a
notion of differentiability is inherited from the fact that the space resembles R" locally. But
“continuity” of maps between topological spaces (not necessarily manifolds) can be defined,
and we say that two such spaces are “homeomorphic,” which means “topologically equivalent
to,” if there is a continuous map between them with a continuous inverse. It is therefore
conceivable that spaces exist which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic; topologically
the same but with distinct “differentiable structures.” In 1964 Milnor showed that S7 had 28
different differentiable structures; it turns out that for n < 7 there is only one differentiable
structure on S", while for n > 7 the number grows very large. R* has infinitely many
differentiable structures.

One piece of conventional calculus that we will need later is the chain rule. Let us
imagine that we have maps f : R™ — R” and g : R* — R/, and therefore the composition

We can represent each space in terms of coordinates: z* on R™, * on R™, and z° on
R!, where the indices range over the appropriate values. The chain rule relates the partial
