There is nothing illegal or immoral about using this form of the chain rule, but you should
be able to visualize the maps that underlie the construction. Recall that when m = n
the determinant of the matrix dy®/0z¢ is called the Jacobian of the map, and the map is
invertible whenever the Jacobian is nonzero.

These basic definitions were presumably familiar to you, even if only vaguely remembered.
We will now put them to use in the rigorous definition of a manifold. Unfortunately, a
somewhat baroque procedure is required to formalize this relatively intuitive notion. We
will first have to define the notion of an open set, on which we can put coordinate systems,
and then sew the open sets together in an appropriate way.

Start with the notion of an open ball, which is the set of all points = in R™ such that
|z —y| < r for some fixed y € R" and r € R, where |z — y| = [¥;(2’ — 7)?]/2. Note that
this is a strict inequality — the open ball is the interior of an n-sphere of radius r centered
at y.

An open set in R" is a set constructed from an arbitrary (maybe infinite) union of open
balls. In other words, V' C R™ is open if, for any y € V, there is an open ball centered
at y which is completely inside V. Roughly speaking, an open set is the interior of some
(n — 1)-dimensional closed surface (or the union of several such interiors). By defining a
notion of open sets, we have equipped R™ with a topology — in this case, the “standard
metric topology.”
