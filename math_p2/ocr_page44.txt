A chart or coordinate system consists of a subset U of a set M, along with a one-to-
one map ¢ : U — R", such that the image ¢(U) is open in R. (Any map is onto its image,
so the map ¢ : U — ¢(U) is invertible.) We then can say that U is an open set in M. (We
have thus induced a topology on M, although we will not explore this.)

A C°° atlas is an indexed collection of charts {(Us, @)} which satisfies two conditions:
1. The union of the U, is equal to M; that is, the U, cover M.
2. The charts are smoothly sewn together. More precisely, if two charts overlap, U,NUs #
0, then the map (¢q 0 ¢5') takes points in ¢g(Us N Us) C R™ onto ¢a(Us NUs) C R™,
and all of these maps must be C* where they are defined. This should be clearer in
pictures:
