2 MANIFOLDS 38
So a chart is what we normally think of as a coordinate system on some open set, and an
atlas is a system of charts which are smoothly related on their overlaps.

At long last, then: a C'* n-dimensional manifold (or n-manifold for short) is simply
a set M along with a “maximal atlas”, one that contains every possible compatible chart.
(We can also replace C* by C? in all the above definitions. For our purposes the degree of
differentiability of a manifold is not crucial; we will always assume that any manifold is as
differentiable as necessary for the application under consideration.) The requirement that
the atlas be maximal is so that two equivalent spaces equipped with different atlases don’t
count as different manifolds. This definition captures in formal terms our notion of a set
that looks locally like R™. Of course we will rarely have to make use of the full power of the
definition, but precision is its own reward.

One thing that is nice about our definition is that it does not rely on an embedding of the
manifold in some higher-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact any n-dimensional manifold
can be embedded in R?" (“Whitney’s embedding theorem”), and sometimes we will make
use of this fact (such as in our definition of the sphere above). But it’s important to recognize
that the manifold has an individual existence independent of any embedding. We have no
reason to believe, for example, that four-dimensional spacetime is stuck in some larger space.
(Actually a number of people, string theorists and so forth, believe that our four-dimensional
world is part of a ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime, but as far as GR is concerned the
4-dimensional view is perfectly adequate.)

Why was it necessary to be so finicky about charts and their overlaps, rather than just
covering every manifold with a single chart? Because most manifolds cannot be covered
with just one chart. Consider the simplest example, S'. There is a conventional coordinate
system, 6 : S* — R, where 6 = 0 at the top of the circle and wraps around to 27. However,
in the definition of a chart we have required that the image 6(S') be open in R. If we include
either §# = 0 or § = 27, we have a closed interval rather than an open one; if we exclude both
points, we haven’t covered the whole circle. So we need at least two charts, as shown.
