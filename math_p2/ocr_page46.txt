chart will cover the manifold. A Mercator projection, traditionally used for world maps,
misses both the North and South poles (as well as the International Date Line, which involves
the same problem with @ that we found for S*.) Let’s take S? to be the set of points in R?
defined by (z')? + (2%)% + (2%)? = 1. We can construct a chart from an open set U, defined
to be the sphere minus the north pole, via “stereographic projection”:
<3
=  x2
X!
!
Thus, we draw a straight line from the north pole to the plane defined by 2* = —1, and
assign to the point on S? intercepted by the line the Cartesian coordinates (y',y?) of the
appropriate point on the plane. Explicitly, the map is given by
22! 222
1,2 03y — (1 2
et =y )= l—s, ——= | - 2.4
b .5 = (4 47) (1_95-3/1_%3) (2.4)
You are encouraged to check this for yourself. Another chart (Us, ¢2) is obtained by project-
ing from the south pole to the plane defined by x* = +1. The resulting coordinates cover
the sphere minus the south pole, and are given by
2zt 222
1,2 03y (1 L2
o(zt 2% 2) = (2,2°) = | —= , ——= | - 2.5
et ) = (2.2 = (55 ) 25)
Together, these two charts cover the entire manifold, and they overlap in the region —1 <
2% < 41. Another thing you can check is that the composition ¢, 0 ¢; ! is given by
2= (2.6)
[(y")? + (%))
and is C* in the region of overlap. As long as we restrict our attention to this region, (2.6)
is just what we normally think of as a change of coordinates.

We therefore see the necessity of charts and atlases: many manifolds cannot be covered
with a single coordinate system. (Although some can, even ones with nontrivial topology.
Can you think of a single good coordinate system that covers the cylinder, S* x R?) Never-
theless, it is very often most convenient to work with a single chart, and just keep track of
the set of points which aren’t included.
