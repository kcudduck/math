2 MANIFOLDS 40
The fact that manifolds look locally like R, which is manifested by the construction of
coordinate charts, introduces the possibility of analysis on manifolds, including operations
such as differentiation and integration. Consider two manifolds M and N of dimensions m
and n, with coordinate charts ¢ on M and ¢ on N. Imagine we have a function f : M — N,
 —
RN
R™ Yofoq!
Just thinking of M and N as sets, we cannot nonchalantly differentiate the map f, since we
don’t know what such an operation means. But the coordinate charts allow us to construct
the map (o fo¢™!) : R™ — R™ (Feel free to insert the words “where the maps are
defined” wherever appropriate, here and later on.) This is just a map between Euclidean
spaces, and all of the concepts of advanced calculus apply. For example f, thought of as
an N-valued function on M, can be differentiated to obtain df/0x*, where the x# represent
R™. The point is that this notation is a shortcut, and what is really going on is
It would be far too unwieldy (not to mention pedantic) to write out the coordinate maps
explicitly in every case. The shorthand notation of the left-hand-side will be sufficient for
most purposes.

Having constructed this groundwork, we can now proceed to introduce various kinds
of structure on manifolds. We begin with vectors and tangent spaces. In our discussion
of special relativity we were intentionally vague about the definition of vectors and their
relationship to the spacetime. One point that was stressed was the notion of a tangent space
— the set of all vectors at a single point in spacetime. The reason for this emphasis was to
remove from your minds the idea that a vector stretches from one point on the manifold to
another, but instead is just an object associated with a single point. What is temporarily
lost by adopting this view is a way to make sense of statements like “the vector points in
