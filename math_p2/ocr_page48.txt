the z direction” — if the tangent space is merely an abstract vector space associated with
each point, it’s hard to know what this should mean. Now it’s time to fix the problem.

Let’s imagine that we wanted to construct the tangent space at a point p in a manifold
M, using only things that are intrinsic to M (no embeddings in higher-dimensional spaces
etc.). One first guess might be to use our intuitive knowledge that there are objects called
“tangent vectors to curves” which belong in the tangent space. We might therefore consider
the set of all parameterized curves through p — that is, the space of all (nondegenerate)
maps v : R — M such that p is in the image of 7. The temptation is to define the tangent
space as simply the space of all tangent vectors to these curves at the point p. But this is
obviously cheating; the tangent space T}, is supposed to be the space of vectors at p, and
before we have defined this we don’t have an independent notion of what “the tangent vector
to a curve” is supposed to mean. In some coordinate system z* any curve through p defines
an element of R™ specified by the n real numbers da#/d)\ (where \ is the parameter along
the curve), but this map is clearly coordinate-dependent, which is not what we want.

Nevertheless we are on the right track, we just have to make things independent of
coordinates. To this end we define F to be the space of all smooth functions on M (that
is, C°° maps f : M — R). Then we notice that each curve through p defines an operator
on this space, the directional derivative, which maps f — df /d\ (at p). We will make the
following claim: the tangent space T), can be identified with the space of directional derivative
operators along curves through p. To establish this idea we must demonstrate two things:
first, that the space of directional derivatives is a vector space, and second that it is the
vector space we want (it has the same dimensionality as M, yields a natural idea of a vector
pointing along a certain direction, and so on).

The first claim, that directional derivatives form a vector space, seems straightforward
enough. Imagine two operators % and % representing derivatives along two curves through
p. There is no problem adding these and scaling by real numbers, to obtain a new operator
a% + b%. It is not immediately obvious, however, that the space closes; i.e., that the
resulting operator is itself a derivative operator. A good derivative operator is one that
acts linearly on functions, and obeys the conventional Leibniz (product) rule on products
of functions. Our new operator is manifestly linear, so we need to verify that it obeys the
Leibniz rule. We have

(ad(—i\ + b%) (fg) = afg—i + ag% + bfj—i + bg;i—{7
= (a% + b;%) g+ (a% + b%) f. (2.8)
As we had hoped, the product rule is satisfied, and the set of directional derivatives is
therefore a vector space.
