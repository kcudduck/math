Is it the vector space that we would like to identify with the tangent space? The easiest
way to become convinced is to find a basis for the space. Consider again a coordinate chart
with coordinates z#. Then there is an obvious set of n directional derivatives at p, namely
the partial derivatives 0, at p.

We are now going to claim that the partial derivative operators {9,} at p form a basis for
the tangent space T,,. (It follows immediately that T, is n-dimensional, since that is the
number of basis vectors.) To see this we will show that any directional derivative can be
decomposed into a sum of real numbers times partial derivatives. This is in fact just the
familiar expression for the components of a tangent vector, but it’s nice to see it from the
big-machinery approach. Consider an n-manifold M, a coordinate chart ¢ : M — R", a
curve 7 : R — M, and a function f : M — R. This leads to the following tangle of maps:

If X is the parameter along 7, we want to expand the vector/operator % in terms of the
