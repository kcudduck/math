partials 9. Using the chain rule (2.2), we have
d d

The first line simply takes the informal expression on the left hand side and rewrites it as
an honest derivative of the function (f o) : R — R. The second line just comes from the
definition of the inverse map ¢! (and associativity of the operation of composition). The
third line is the formal chain rule (2.2), and the last line is a return to the informal notation
of the start. Since the function f was arbitrary, we have
d dx*
e HQ, . (2.10)
Thus, the partials {9, } do indeed represent a good basis for the vector space of directional
derivatives, which we can therefore safely identify with the tangent space.

Of course, the vector represented by d%‘ is one we already know; it’s the tangent vector
to the curve with parameter A\. Thus (2.10) can be thought of as a restatement of (1.24),
where we claimed the that components of the tangent vector were simply da*/d\. The only
difference is that we are working on an arbitrary manifold, and we have specified our basis
vectors to be ég,) = 0,.

This particular basis (é,) = 0,) is known as a coordinate basis for T); it is the
formalization of the notion of setting up the basis vectors to point along the coordinate
axes. There is no reason why we are limited to coordinate bases when we consider tangent
vectors; it is sometimes more convenient, for example, to use orthonormal bases of some
sort. However, the coordinate basis is very simple and natural, and we will use it almost
exclusively throughout the course.

One of the advantages of the rather abstract point of view we have taken toward vectors
is that the transformation law is immediate. Since the basis vectors are é,) = 0,, the basis
vectors in some new coordinate system 2 are given by the chain rule (2.3) as

Ozt
Oy = WO“ . (2.11)
We can get the transformation law for vector components by the same technique used in flat
space, demanding the the vector V' = V#9,, be unchanged by a change of basis. We have
Ve, = VMo
Ot
= Vv Wa“ , (2.12)
