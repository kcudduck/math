and hence (since the matrix dz* /@z* is the inverse of the matrix dz#/dz ),

VE = —VH. 2.13
Since the basis vectors are usually not written explicitly, the rule (2.13) for transforming
components is what we call the “vector transformation law.” We notice that it is com-
patible with the transformation of vector components in special relativity under Lorentz
transformations, V# = A¥ «VH, since a Lorentz transformation is a special kind of coordi-
nate transformation, with z# = A* x2*. But (2.13) is much more general, as it encompasses
the behavior of vectors under arbitrary changes of coordinates (and therefore bases), not just
linear transformations. As usual, we are trying to emphasize a somewhat subtle ontological
distinction — tensor components do not change when we change coordinates, they change
when we change the basis in the tangent space, but we have decided to use the coordinates
to define our basis. Therefore a change of coordinates induces a change of basis:
xM
Having explored the world of vectors, we continue to retrace the steps we took in flat
space, and now consider dual vectors (one-forms). Once again the cotangent space T, is the
set of linear maps w : 7, — R. The canonical example of a one-form is the gradient of a
function f, denoted df. Its action on a vector % is exactly the directional derivative of the
function:
d df
df {—~|=-~ . 2.14
! (d)x) dA ( )
It’s tempting to think, “why shouldn’t the function f itself be considered the one-form, and
df /d\ its action?” The point is that a one-form, like a vector, exists only at the point it is
defined, and does not depend on information at other points on M. If you know a function
in some neighborhood of a point you can take its derivative, but not just from knowing
its value at the point; the gradient, on the other hand, encodes precisely the information
