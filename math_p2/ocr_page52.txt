necessary to take the directional derivative along any curve through p, fulfilling its role as a
dual vector.

Just as the partial derivatives along coordinate axes provide a natural basis for the
tangent space, the gradients of the coordinate functions z* provide a natural basis for the
cotangent space. Recall that in flat space we constructed a basis for T by demanding that
é(“)(é(y)) = ¢#. Continuing the same philosophy on an arbitrary manifold, we find that (2.14)
leads to Sk

e
dz*(0,) = e or . (2.15)
Therefore the gradients {dz#} are an appropriate set of basis one-forms; an arbitrary one-
form is expanded into components as w = w,, dz*.

The transformation properties of basis dual vectors and components follow from what is

by now the usual procedure. We obtain, for basis one-forms,
;O
da# = —da* , 2.16
and for components,
Ozt
Wi = (2.17)
We will usually write the components w, when we speak about a one-form w.

The transformation law for general tensors follows this same pattern of replacing the
Lorentz transformation matrix used in flat space with a matrix representing more general
coordinate transformations. A (k,[) tensor T can be expanded

T =T, 00y @ - ®0, ®de" @ - - ®dz", (2.18)
and under a coordinate transformation the components change according to

This tensor transformation law is straightforward to remember, since there really isn’t any-
thing else it could be, given the placement of indices. However, it is often easier to transform
a tensor by taking the identity of basis vectors and one-forms as partial derivatives and gradi-
ents at face value, and simply substituting in the coordinate transformation. As an example
consider a symmetric (0,2) tensor S on a 2-dimensional manifold, whose components in a
coordinate system (z! = z,2% = y) are given by
