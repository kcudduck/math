This can be written equivalently as
S = Su(da" ®da”)
= a(de)? + (dy)? (2.21)
where in the last line the tensor product symbols are suppressed for brevity. Now consider
new coordinates
JL'/ — xl/B
y o= Y. (2.22)
This leads directly to
r = (CE’)B
y = W(y)— @)
de = 3(2)*de’
1
dy = v dy’ —3(2")*da’ . (2.23)
We need only plug these expressions directly into (2.21) to obtain (remembering that tensor
products don’t commute, so da’ dy’ # dy’ da’):
"4 "3 "2 @2 ’ oy 1 "2
S =9(2)! 1+ (2)°](d2")* — 3=——(dz' dy’ + dy/' da’) + W(dy) , (2.24)

Sy = ( Y PR (2.25)
Y (v)?
Notice that it is still symmetric. We did not use the transformation law (2.19) directly, but
doing so would have yielded the same result, as you can check.

For the most part the various tensor operations we defined in flat space are unaltered
in a more general setting: contraction, symmetrization, etc. There are three important
exceptions: partial derivatives, the metric, and the Levi-Civita tensor. Let’s look at the
partial derivative first.

The unfortunate fact is that the partial derivative of a tensor is not, in general, a new
tensor. The gradient, which is the partial derivative of a scalar, is an honest (0,1) tensor, as
we have seen. But the partial derivative of higher-rank tensors is not tensorial, as we can see
by considering the partial derivative of a one-form, 9,W,, and changing to a new coordinate
system:
