The second term in the last line should not be there if J,W, were to transform as a (0, 2)
tensor. As you can see, it arises because the derivative of the transformation matrix does
not vanish, as it did for Lorentz transformations in flat space.

On the other hand, the exterior derivative operator d does form an antisymmetric (0, p+1)
tensor when acted on a p-form. For p = 1 we can see this from (2.26); the offending non-
tensorial term can be written

w, Ju 0 Oty O (2.27)

This expression is symmetric in g and ¢/, since partial derivatives commute. But the exterior
derivative is defined to be the antisymmetrized partial derivative, so this term vanishes
(the antisymmetric part of a symmetric expression is zero). We are then left with the
correct tensor transformation law; extension to arbitrary p is straightforward. So the exterior
derivative is a legitimate tensor operator; it is not, however, an adequate substitute for the
partial derivative, since it is only defined on forms. In the next section we will define a
covariant derivative, which can be thought of as the extension of the partial derivative to
arbitrary manifolds.

The metric tensor is such an important object in curved space that it is given a new
symbol, g,, (while 7, is reserved specifically for the Minkowski metric). There are few
restrictions on the components of g,,, other than that it be a symmetric (0,2) tensor. It is
usually taken to be non-degenerate, meaning that the determinant g = |g,,| doesn’t vanish.
This allows us to define the inverse metric g"” via

9" s = 0 . (2.28)
The symmetry of g,, implies that ¢g" is also symmetric. Just as in special relativity, the
metric and its inverse may be used to raise and lower indices on tensors.

It will take several weeks to fully appreciate the role of the metric in all of its glory, but
for purposes of inspiration we can list the various uses to which g, will be put: (1) the
metric supplies a notion of “past” and “future”; (2) the metric allows the computation of
path length and proper time; (3) the metric determines the “shortest distance” between two
points (and therefore the motion of test particles); (4) the metric replaces the Newtonian
gravitational field ¢; (5) the metric provides a notion of locally inertial frames and therefore
a sense of “no rotation”; (6) the metric determines causality, by defining the speed of light
faster than which no signal can travel; (7) the metric replaces the traditional Euclidean
three-dimensional dot product of Newtonian mechanics; and so on. Obviously these ideas
are not all completely independent, but we get some sense of the importance of this tensor.

In our discussion of path lengths in special relativity we (somewhat handwavingly) in-
troduced the line element as ds* = 1, dz*dz”, which was used to get the length of a path.
