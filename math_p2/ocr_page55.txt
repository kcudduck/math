Of course now that we know that dz* is really a basis dual vector, it becomes natural to use
the terms “metric” and “line element” interchangeably, and write
ds? = g, dat da” . (2.29)
(To be perfectly consistent we should write this as “¢g”, and sometimes will, but more often
than not g is used for the determinant |g,,|.) For example, we know that the Euclidean line
element in a three-dimensional space with Cartesian coordinates is
ds? = (dz)? + (dy)* + (d2)? . (2.30)
We can now change to any coordinate system we choose. For example, in spherical coordi-
nates we have
r = rsinfcos¢
y = rsinfsing
z = rcosf, (2.31)
which leads directly to
ds® = dr* + 7% d6* + r?sin® 0 dg* . (2.32)
Obviously the components of the metric look different than those in Cartesian coordinates,
but all of the properties of the space remain unaltered.

Perhaps this is a good time to note that most references are not sufficiently picky to
distinguish between “dz”, the informal notion of an infinitesimal displacement, and “dz”,
the rigorous notion of a basis one-form given by the gradient of a coordinate function. In
fact our notation “ds®” does not refer to the exterior derivative of anything, or the square of
anything; it’s just conventional shorthand for the metric tensor. On the other hand, “(dz)?”
refers specifically to the (0,2) tensor dz ® dz.

A good example of a space with curvature is the two-sphere, which can be thought of as
the locus of points in R? at distance 1 from the origin. The metric in the (8, ¢) coordinate
system comes from setting 7 = 1 and dr = 0 in (2.32):

ds? = d6* +sin? 0 d¢? . (2.33)
This is completely consistent with the interpretation of ds as an infinitesimal length, as
illustrated in the figure.

As we shall see, the metric tensor contains all the information we need to describe the
curvature of the manifold (at least in Riemannian geometry; we will actually indicate some-
what more general approaches). In Minkowski space we can choose coordinates in which the
components of the metric are constant; but it should be clear that the existence of curvature
