is more subtle than having the metric depend on the coordinates, since in the example above
we showed how the metric in flat Euclidean space in spherical coordinates is a function of r
and 0. Later, we shall see that constancy of the metric components is sufficient for a space
to be flat, and in fact there always exists a coordinate system on any flat space in which
the metric is constant. But we might not want to work in such a coordinate system, and we
might not even know how to find it; therefore we will want a more precise characterization
of the curvature, which will be introduced down the road.

A useful characterization of the metric is obtained by putting g, into its canonical
form. In this form the metric components become

gw = diag (—=1,—1,...,—1,+1,+1,...,4+1,0,0,...,0) , (2.34)

where “diag” means a diagonal matrix with the given elements. If n is the dimension of
the manifold, s is the number of +1’s in the canonical form, and ¢ is the number of —1’s,
then s — t is the signature of the metric (the difference in the number of minus and plus
signs), and s + ¢ is the rank of the metric (the number of nonzero eigenvalues). If a metric
is continuous, the rank and signature of the metric tensor field are the same at every point,
and if the metric is nondegenerate the rank is equal to the dimension n. We will always deal
with continuous, nondegenerate metrics. If all of the signs are positive (¢ = 0) the metric
is called Euclidean or Riemannian (or just “positive definite”), while if there is a single
minus (¢ = 1) it is called Lorentzian or pseudo-Riemannian, and any metric with some
+1’s and some —1’s is called “indefinite.” (So the word “Euclidean” sometimes means that
the space is flat, and sometimes doesn’t, but always means that the canonical form is strictly
positive; the terminology is unfortunate but standard.) The spacetimes of interest in general
relativity have Lorentzian metrics.

We haven’t yet demonstrated that it is always possible to but the metric into canonical
form. In fact it is always possible to do so at some point p € M, but in general it will
