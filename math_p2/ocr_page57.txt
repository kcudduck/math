only be possible at that single point, not in any neighborhood of p. Actually we can do
slightly better than this; it turns out that at any point p there exists a coordinate system in
which g,,, takes its canonical form and the first derivatives d,g,, all vanish (while the second
derivatives 9,0,9,, cannot be made to all vanish). Such coordinates are known as Riemann
normal coordinates, and the associated basis vectors constitute a local Lorentz frame.
Notice that in Riemann normal coordinates (or RNC’s) the metric at p looks like that of flat
space “to first order.” This is the rigorous notion of the idea that “small enough regions of
spacetime look like flat (Minkowski) space.” (Also, there is no difficulty in simultaneously
constructing sets of basis vectors at every point in M such that the metric takes its canonical
form; the problem is that in general this will not be a coordinate basis, and there will be no
way to make it into one.)

We won’t consider the detailed proof of this statement; it can be found in Schutz, pp. 158-
160, where it goes by the name of the “local flatness theorem.” (He also calls local Lorentz
frames “momentarily comoving reference frames,” or MCRF’s.) It is useful to see a sketch
of the proof, however, for the specific case of a Lorentzian metric in four dimensions. The
idea is to consider the transformation law for the metric

of the old coordinates z* looks like

with the other expansions proceeding along the same lines. (For simplicity we have set
2#(p) = 2*(p) = 0.) Then, using some extremely schematic notation, the expansion of
(2.35) to second order is

We can set terms of equal order in 2’ on each side equal to each other. Therefore, the
components g,/,/(p), 10 numbers in all (to describe a symmetric two-index tensor), are
determined by the matrix (92*/82*),. This is a 4 x 4 matrix with no constraints; thus,
16 numbers we are free to choose. Clearly this is enough freedom to put the 10 numbers of
guw(p) into canonical form, at least as far as having enough degrees of freedom is concerned.
