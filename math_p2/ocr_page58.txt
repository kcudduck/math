2 MANIFOLDS 51
(In fact there are some limitations — if you go through the procedure carefully, you find
for example that you cannot change the signature and rank.) The six remaining degrees of
freedom can be interpreted as exactly the six parameters of the Lorentz group; we know that
these leave the canonical form unchanged. At first order we have the derivatives 0y g,v.(p),
four derivatives of ten components for a total of 40 numbers. But looking at the right hand
side of (2.37) we see that we now have the additional freedom to choose (82x* /dx*: dx#),. In
this set of numbers there are 10 independent choices of the indices p} and p} (it’s symmetric,
since partial derivatives commute) and four choices of y, for a total of 40 degrees of freedom.
This is precisely the amount of choice we need to determine all of the first derivatives of the
metric, which we can therefore set to zero. At second order, however, we are concerned with
Oy O gy (p); this is symmetric in p" and o' as well as ¢/ and v/, for a total of 10 x 10 = 100
numbers. Our ability to make additional choices is contained in (93z#/dz*idzt2dx"s),.
This is symmetric in the three lower indices, which gives 20 possibilities, times four for the
upper index gives us 80 degrees of freedom — 20 fewer than we require to set the second
derivatives of the metric to zero. So in fact we cannot make the second derivatives vanish;
the deviation from flatness must therefore be measured by the 20 coordinate-independent
degrees of freedom representing the second derivatives of the metric tensor field. We will
see later how this comes about, when we characterize curvature using the Riemann tensor,
which will turn out to have 20 independent components.

The final change we have to make to our tensor knowledge now that we have dropped
the assumption of flat space has to do with the Levi-Civita tensor, €., uy...u,- Remember that
the flat-space version of this object, which we will now denote by €, ,....,, was defined as

{ +1if g - - - py is an even permutation of 01---(n —1) ,
Epnpigepn = § —1if pypin - - - pi, is an odd permutation of 01---(n—1), (2.38)
0 otherwise .
We will now define the Levi-Civita symbol to be exactly this €,,,,...,, — that is, an object
with n indices which has the components specified above in any coordinate system. This is
called a “symbol,” of course, because it is not a tensor; it is defined not to change under
coordinate transformations. We can relate its behavior to that of an ordinary tensor by first
noting that, given some n x n matrix M*,/, the determinant |M| obeys
g#'l#'z"'#% |]W| = €1 pg-ropin ]\/[“1#/1 ]\/[“2#/2 s ]\/[“”NLL . (2.39)
This is just a true fact about the determinant which you can find in a sufficiently enlightened
linear algebra book. If follows that, setting M*, = dx*/ 0z" , we have
