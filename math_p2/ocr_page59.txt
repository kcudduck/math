This is close to the tensor transformation law, except for the determinant out front. Objects
which transform in this way are known as tensor densities. Another example is given by
the determinant of the metric, g = |gu|. It's easy to check (by taking the determinant of
both sides of (2.35)) that under a coordinate transformation we get
ot |72
oa#) =G| otat) (241
Therefore ¢ is also not a tensor; it transforms in a way similar to the Levi-Civita symbol,
except that the Jacobian is raised to the —2 power. The power to which the Jacobian is
raised is known as the weight of the tensor density; the Levi-Civita symbol is a density of
weight 1, while g is a (scalar) density of weight —2.

However, we don’t like tensor densities, we like tensors. There is a simple way to convert
a density into an honest tensor — multiply by |g|*/2, where w is the weight of the density
(the absolute value signs are there because g < 0 for Lorentz metrics). The result will
transform according to the tensor transformation law. Therefore, for example, we can define
the Levi-Civita tensor as

Cunpzsin = V19| Gz - (2.42)
It is this tensor which is used in the definition of the Hodge dual, (1.87), which is otherwise
unchanged when generalized to arbitrary manifolds. Since this is a real tensor, we can raise
indices, etc. Sometimes people define a version of the Levi-Civita symbol with upper indices,
etmmztin - whose components are numerically equal to the symbol with lower indices. This

turns out to be a density of weight —1, and is related to the tensor with upper indices by
eMh2in — gon(g) —— ethehn (2.43)

As an aside, we should come clean and admit that, even with the factor of \/m the
Levi-Civita tensor is in some sense not a true tensor, because on some manifolds it cannot
be globally defined. Those on which it can be defined are called orientable, and we will
deal exclusively with orientable manifolds in this course. An example of a non-orientable
manifold is the Mobius strip; see Schutz’s Geometrical Methods in Mathematical Physics
(or a similar text) for a discussion.

One final appearance of tensor densities is in integration on manifolds. We will not do this
subject justice, but at least a casual glance is necessary. You have probably been exposed
to the fact that in ordinary calculus on R™ the volume element d"x picks up a factor of the
Jacobian under change of coordinates:

d"a' = ’%‘ d"z . (2.44)
