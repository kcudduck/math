2 MANIFOLDS 53
There is actually a beautiful explanation of this formula from the point of view of differential
forms, which arises from the following fact: on an n-dimensional manifold, the integrand is
properly understood as an n-form. The naive volume element d"x is itself a density rather
than an n-form, but there is no difficulty in using it to construct a real n-form. To see how
this works, we should make the identification
d"z — da® Ao A da (2.45)
The expression on the right hand side can be misleading, because it looks like a tensor (an
n-form, actually) but is really a density. Certainly if we have two functions f and g on M,
then df and dg are one-forms, and df A dg is a two-form. But we would like to interpret
the right hand side of (2.45) as a coordinate-dependent object which, in the z* coordinate
system, acts like da® A --- A dz"~!. This sounds tricky, but in fact it’s just an ambiguity of
notation, and in practice we will just use the shorthand notation “d"z”.
To justify this song and dance, let’s see how (2.45) changes under coordinate transfor-
mations. First notice that the definition of the wedge product allows us to write
dO d"*lf L. dxtt dah 2.46
2’ A A de = i A2 A A dat (2.46)
since both the wedge product and the Levi-Civita symbol are completely antisymmetric. Un-
der a coordinate transformation €,,...,, stays the same while the one-forms change according
to (2.16), leading to
~ . - Ozt Oxbn Y
€y AT A A dat = Cprein o G dz#r Ao A datn
ozt | _ / /
= ‘W’ €y, AT NN dat (2.47)
Multiplying by the Jacobian on both sides recovers (2.44).
It is clear that the naive volume element d"z transforms as a density, not a tensor, but
it is straightforward to construct an invariant volume element by multiplying by +/|g]:
VIgldz® A--- A da® V" = /|g|da® A - A da™ L, (2.48)
which is of course just (n!) ™ €y, dz#t A -+ A datr. In the interest of simplicity we will
usually write the volume element as /|g| d"xz, rather than as the explicit wedge product
/lgldz® A+ - A daz™1; it will be enough to keep in mind that it’s supposed to be an n-form.
As a final aside to finish this section, let’s consider one of the most elegant and powerful
theorems of differential geometry: Stokes’s theorem. This theorem is the generalization of
the fundamental theorem of calculus, f;'dx = a — b. Imagine that we have an n-manifold
