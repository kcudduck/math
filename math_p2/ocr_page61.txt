M with boundary M, and an (n — 1)-form w on M. (We haven’t discussed manifolds with
boundaries, but the idea is obvious; M could for instance be the interior of an (n — 1)-
dimensional closed surface 9M.) Then dw is an n-form, which can be integrated over M,
while w itself can be integrated over M. Stokes’s theorem is then
/ dw = / w. (2.49)

You can convince yourself that different special cases of this theorem include not only the
fundamental theorem of calculus, but also the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes, familiar
from vector calculus in three dimensions.
