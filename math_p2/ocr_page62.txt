3 Curvature

In our discussion of manifolds, it became clear that there were various notions we could talk
about as soon as the manifold was defined; we could define functions, take their derivatives,
consider parameterized paths, set up tensors, and so on. Other concepts, such as the volume
of a region or the length of a path, required some additional piece of structure, namely the
introduction of a metric. It would be natural to think of the notion of “curvature”, which we
have already used informally, is something that depends on the metric. Actually this turns
out to be not quite true, or at least incomplete. In fact there is one additional structure
we need to introduce — a “connection” — which is characterized by the curvature. We will
show how the existence of a metric implies a certain connection, whose curvature may be
thought of as that of the metric.

The connection becomes necessary when we attempt to address the problem of the partial
derivative not being a good tensor operator. What we would like is a covariant derivative;
that is, an operator which reduces to the partial derivative in flat space with Cartesian
coordinates, but transforms as a tensor on an arbitrary manifold. It is conventional to spend
a certain amount of time motivating the introduction of a covariant derivative, but in fact
the need is obvious; equations such as J,7* = 0 are going to have to be generalized to
curved space somehow. So let’s agree that a covariant derivative would be a good thing to
have, and go about setting it up.

In flat space in Cartesian coordinates, the partial derivative operator 0, is a map from
(k. 1) tensor fields to (k, I+1) tensor fields, which acts linearly on its arguments and obeys the
Leibniz rule on tensor products. All of this continues to be true in the more general situation
we would now like to consider, but the map provided by the partial derivative depends on the
coordinate system used. We would therefore like to define a covariant derivative operator
V to perform the functions of the partial derivative, but in a way independent of coordinates.
We therefore require that V be a map from (k, [) tensor fields to (k,!+1) tensor fields which
has these two properties:

1. linearity: V(T +S5)=VT + VS ;

2. Leibniz (product) rule: V(T ® S)=(VI) @S +T® (VS) .

If V is going to obey the Leibniz rule, it can always be written as the partial derivative
plus some linear transformation. That is, to take the covariant derivative we first take the
partial derivative, and then apply a correction to make the result covariant. (We aren’t going
to prove this reasonable-sounding statement, but Wald goes into detail if you are interested.)
