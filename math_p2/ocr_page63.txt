3 CURVATURE 56
Let’s consider what this means for the covariant derivative of a vector V”. It means that, for
each direction p, the covariant derivative V,, will be given by the partial derivative 9, plus
a correction specified by a matrix (I',)?, (an n x n matrix, where n is the dimensionality of
the manifold, for each p). In fact the parentheses are usually dropped and we write these
matrices, known as the connection coefficients, with haphazard index placement as |
We therefore have
V,.V'=09,V¥ + FZ,AV’\ . (3.1)
Notice that in the second term the index originally on V' has moved to the I', and a new index
is summed over. If this is the expression for the covariant derivative of a vector in terms of
the partial derivative, we should be able to determine the transformation properties of IR
by demanding that the left hand side be a (1, 1) tensor. That is, we want the transformation
law to be ;
, Oxt v
v _ 7 T 4
VvV = 9o D v,V (3.2)
Let’s look at the left side first; we can expand it using (3.1) and then transform the parts
that we understand:
, / Y
VNIVV = E)urV" + FZ//\;V
oz Oz’ Oz o oz ;oY
L DO e Oy D 0 O (33)
Oxr Oxv oz Ozk Oxv A O
The right side, meanwhile, can likewise be expanded:
dx* Oz’ Ox* Oz’ dx* Oz’
——V,V'=—=——0,V"+ L TY V. (3.4)

These last two expressions are to be equated; the first terms in each are identical and therefore
cancel, so we have
o dat 0 dz¥  dat OV
My VA VA = TV (3.5)
WA DA ozt Ozt Ox*  OxW Oxv M
where we have changed a dummy index from v to A. This equation must be true for any
vector V?*, so we can eliminate that on both sides. Then the connection coefficients in the
primed coordinates may be isolated by multiplying by 0z*/92* . The result is
, Azt O ¥’ Azt O B2V

This is not, of course, the tensor transformation law; the second term on the right spoils it.
That’s okay, because the connection coefficients are not the components of a tensor. They
are purposefully constructed to be non-tensorial, but in such a way that the combination
(3.1) transforms as a tensor — the extra terms in the transformation of the partials and
