the I'’s exactly cancel. This is why we are not so careful about index placement on the
connection coefficients; they are not a tensor, and therefore you should try not to raise and
lower their indices.

What about the covariant derivatives of other sorts of tensors? By similar reasoning to
that used for vectors, the covariant derivative of a one-form can also be expressed as a partial
derivative plus some linear transformation. But there is no reason as yet that the matrices
representing this transformation should be related to the coefficients I';,. In general we
could write something like

Vwy, = 0uw, + F:ywA , (3.7)
where f‘f;u is a new set of matrices for each pu. (Pay attention to where all of the various
indices go.) It is straightforward to derive that the transformation properties of I' must be
the same as those of T', but otherwise no relationship has been established. To do so, we
need to introduce two new properties that we would like our covariant derivative to have (in
addition to the two above):

3. commutes with contractions: V,(T%y,) = (VT), s, ,

4. reduces to the partial derivative on scalars: V,¢ = 0d,¢ .

There is no way to “derive” these properties; we are simply demanding that they be true as
part of the definition of a covariant derivative.

Let’s see what these new properties imply. Given some one-form field w, and vector field
V*#, we can take the covariant derivative of the scalar defined by w\V* to get

v,‘,(W)\VA) = (VHOJ)\)VX + W)‘(VIA,VA)
AT A A A
= (Qun)V +TwoV +wa(9,V7) + il Ve (3.8)
But since wyV* is a scalar, this must also be given by the partial derivative:
Vu(w,\VA) = au(wkv)\)
= (Quwn)V* +wy(3,V) . (3.9)
This can only be true if the terms in (3.8) with connection coefficients cancel each other;
that is, rearranging dummy indices, we must have
0=T7w,V* + Tw, V. (3.10)
But both w, and V* are completely arbitrary, so
Loy =-T0 - (3.11)
