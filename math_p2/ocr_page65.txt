3 CURVATURE 58
The two extra conditions we have imposed therefore allow us to express the covariant deriva-
tive of a one-form using the same connection coefficients as were used for the vector, but
now with a minus sign (and indices matched up somewhat differently):

V,wy, = 0w, — Ff;,,w)\ . (3.12)

It should come as no surprise that the connection coefficients encode all of the information
necessary to take the covariant derivative of a tensor of arbitrary rank. The formula is quite
straightforward; for each upper index you introduce a term with a single 4+I', and for each
lower index a term with a single —1I":

This is the general expression for the covariant derivative. You can check it yourself; it
comes from the set of axioms we have established, and the usual requirements that tensors
of various sorts be coordinate-independent entities. Sometimes an alternative notation is
used; just as commas are used for partial derivatives, semicolons are used for covariant ones:
Vb2 be iy = T2 o - (3.14)
Once again, I'm not a big fan of this notation.

To define a covariant derivative, then, we need to put a “connection” on our manifold,
which is specified in some coordinate system by a set of coefficients I‘f;u (n® = 64 independent
components in n = 4 dimensions) which transform according to (3.6). (The name “connec-
tion” comes from the fact that it is used to transport vectors from one tangent space to
another, as we will soon see.) There are evidently a large number of connections we could
define on any manifold, and each of them implies a distinct notion of covariant differentia-
tion. In general relativity this freedom is not a big concern, because it turns out that every
metric defines a unique connection, which is the one used in GR. Let’s see how that works.

The first thing to notice is that the difference of two connections is a (1,2) tensor. If
we have two sets of connection coefficients, I'},, and I'),,, their difference S,,* =T, — '},
(notice index placement) transforms as
