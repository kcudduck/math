This is just the tensor transormation law, so S,,* is indeed a tensor. This implies that any
set of connections can be expressed as some fiducial connection plus a tensorial correction.

Next notice that, given a connection specified by Ffm, we can immediately form another
connection simply by permuting the lower indices. That is, the set of coefficients I" ;\u will
also transform according to (3.6) (since the partial derivatives appearing in the last term
can be commuted), so they determine a distinct connection. There is thus a tensor we can
associate with any given connection, known as the torsion tensor, defined by

A A A A

TH” = F;w - Ft/u = QF[;W] : (316)

It is clear that the torsion is antisymmetric its lower indices, and a connection which is
symmetric in its lower indices is known as “torsion-free.”

We can now define a unique connection on a manifold with a metric g, by introducing
two additional properties:

; CTAY A

o torsion-free: I'j, =TT,

e metric compatibility: V,g,, = 0.

A connection is metric compatible if the covariant derivative of the metric with respect to
that connection is everywhere zero. This implies a couple of nice properties. First, it’s easy
to show that the inverse metric also has zero covariant derivative,
V" =0. (3.17)
Second, a metric-compatible covariant derivative commutes with raising and lowering of
indices. Thus, for some vector field V?*,
A A

GuaV,V" = Vp(guAV )= VoV (3.18)
With non-metric-compatible connections one must be very careful about index placement
when taking a covariant derivative.

Our claim is therefore that there is exactly one torsion-free connection on a given manifold
which is compatible with some given metric on that manifold. We do not want to make these
two requirements part of the definition of a covariant derivative; they simply single out one
of the many possible ones.

We can demonstrate both existence and uniqueness by deriving a manifestly unique
expression for the connection coefficients in terms of the metric. To accomplish this, we
expand out the equation of metric compatibility for three different permutations of the
indices:

Vol = OpGuw — Lougnw = Tpgun =0
