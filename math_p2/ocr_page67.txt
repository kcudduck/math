Vido = 0udpu = L0gru = Tougon = 0. (3.19)
We subtract the second and third of these from the first, and use the symmetry of the
connection to obtain
Ay — OuGup — OuGp + 2T p 00 = 0 . (3.20)
It is straightforward to solve this for the connection by multiplying by ¢?”. The result is
I, = %g”"(aug»p + 0 Gpu = OpGuw) - (3.21)
This is one of the most important formulas in this subject; commit it to memory. Of course,
we have only proved that if a metric-compatible and torsion-free connection exists, it must
be of the form (3.21); you can check for yourself (for those of you without enough tedious
computation in your lives) that the right hand side of (3.21) transforms like a connection.

This connection we have derived from the metric is the one on which conventional general
relativity is based (although we will keep an open mind for a while longer). It is known
by different names: sometimes the Christoffel connection, sometimes the Levi-Civita
connection, sometimes the Riemannian connection. The associated connection coefficients
are sometimes called Christoffel symbols and written as { ,jj,}; we will sometimes call
them Christoffel symbols, but we won'’t use the funny notation. The study of manifolds with
metrics and their associated connections is called “Riemannian geometry.” As far as I can
tell the study of more general connections can be traced back to Cartan, but I've never heard
it called “Cartanian geometry.”

Before putting our covariant derivatives to work, we should mention some miscellaneous
properties. First, let’s emphasize again that the connection does not have to be constructed
from the metric. In ordinary flat space there is an implicit connection we use all the time
— the Christoffel connection constructed from the flat metric. But we could, if we chose,
use a different connection, while keeping the metric flat. Also notice that the coefficients
of the Christoffel connection in flat space will vanish in Cartesian coordinates, but not in
curvilinear coordinate systems. Consider for example the plane in polar coordinates, with
metric

ds? = dr? +r2d6* . (3.22)
The nonzero components of the inverse metric are readily found to be ¢"" = 1 and g% = r=2.
(Notice that we use r and € as indices in an obvious notation.) We can compute a typical
connection coefficient:
F:r = %gm(&‘gm + ar!]m‘ - apgw)
= %g"(argrr + G — Orgrr)
