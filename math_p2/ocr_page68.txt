The existence of nonvanishing connection coefficients in curvilinear coordinate systems is
the ultimate cause of the formulas for the divergence and so on that you find in books on
electricity and magnetism.

Contrariwise, even in a curved space it is still possible to make the Christoffel symbols
vanish at any one point. This is just because, as we saw in the last section, we can always
make the first derivative of the metric vanish at a point; so by (3.21) the connection coeffi-
cients derived from this metric will also vanish. Of course this can only be established at a
point, not in some neighborhood of the point.

Another useful property is that the formula for the divergence of a vector (with respect
to the Christoffel connection) has a simplified form. The covariant divergence of V* is given
by

V.Vt =0, V" + FZ/\V)‘ . (3.26)
It’s easy to show (see pp. 106-108 of Weinberg) that the Christoffel connection satisfies
