There are also formulas for the divergences of higher-rank tensors, but they are generally
not such a great simplification.

As the last factoid we should mention about connections, let us emphasize (once more)
that the exterior derivative is a well-defined tensor in the absence of any connection. The
reason this needs to be emphasized is that, if you happen to be using a symmetric (torsion-
free) connection, the exterior derivative (defined to be the antisymmetrized partial derivative)
happens to be equal to the antisymmetrized covariant derivative:

Vi) = Oy = Tjwn
This has led some misfortunate souls to fret about the “ambiguity” of the exterior derivative
in spaces with torsion, where the above simplification does not occur. There is no ambiguity:
the exterior derivative does not involve the connection, no matter what connection you
happen to be using, and therefore the torsion never enters the formula for the exterior
derivative of anything.

Before moving on, let’s review the process by which we have been adding structures to
our mathematical constructs. We started with the basic notion of a set, which you were
presumed to know (informally, if not rigorously). We introduced the concept of open subsets
of our set; this is equivalent to introducing a topology, and promoted the set to a topological
space. Then by demanding that each open set look like a region of R™ (with n the same for
each set) and that the coordinate charts be smoothly sewn together, the topological space
became a manifold. A manifold is simultaneously a very flexible and powerful structure,
and comes equipped naturally with a tangent bundle, tensor bundles of various ranks, the
ability to take exterior derivatives, and so forth. We then proceeded to put a metric on
the manifold, resulting in a manifold with metric (or sometimes “Riemannian manifold”).
Independently of the metric we found we could introduce a connection, allowing us to take
covariant derivatives. Once we have a metric, however, there is automatically a unique
torsion-free metric-compatible connection. (In principle there is nothing to stop us from
introducing more than one connection, or more than one metric, on any given manifold.)
The situation is thus as portrayed in the diagram on the next page.
