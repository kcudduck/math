Having set up the machinery of connections, the first thing we will do is discuss parallel
transport. Recall that in flat space it was unnecessary to be very careful about the fact
that vectors were elements of tangent spaces defined at individual points; it is actually very
natural to compare vectors at different points (where by “compare” we mean add, subtract,
take the dot product, etc.). The reason why it is natural is because it makes sense, in flat
space, to “move a vector from one point to another while keeping it constant.” Then once
we get the vector from one point to another we can do the usual operations allowed in a
vector space.

The concept of moving a vector along a path, keeping constant all the while, is known

as parallel transport. As we shall see, parallel transport is defined whenever we have a
