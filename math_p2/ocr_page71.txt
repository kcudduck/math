3 CURVATURE 64
connection; the intuitive manipulation of vectors in flat space makes implicit use of the
Christoffel connection on this space. The crucial difference between flat and curved spaces is
that, in a curved space, the result of parallel transporting a vector from one point to another
will depend on the path taken between the points. Without yet assembling the complete
mechanism of parallel transport, we can use our intuition about the two-sphere to see that
this is the case. Start with a vector on the equator, pointing along a line of constant
longitude. Parallel transport it up to the north pole along a line of longitude in the obvious
way. Then take the original vector, parallel transport it along the equator by an angle 6, and
then move it up to the north pole as before. It is clear that the vector, parallel transported
along two paths, arrived at the same destination with two different values (rotated by 6).
It therefore appears as if there is no natural way to uniquely move a vector from one
tangent space to another; we can always parallel transport it, but the result depends on the
path, and there is no natural choice of which path to take. Unlike some of the problems we
have encountered, there is no solution to this one — we simply must learn to live with the
fact that two vectors can only be compared in a natural way if they are elements of the same
tangent space. For example, two particles passing by each other have a well-defined relative
velocity (which cannot be greater than the speed of light). But two particles at different
points on a curved manifold do not have any well-defined notion of relative velocity — the
concept simply makes no sense. Of course, in certain special situations it is still useful to talk
as if it did make sense, but it is necessary to understand that occasional usefulness is not a
substitute for rigorous definition. In cosmology, for example, the light from distant galaxies
is redshifted with respect to the frequencies we would observe from a nearby stationary
source. Since this phenomenon bears such a close resemblance to the conventional Doppler
effect due to relative motion, it is very tempting to say that the galaxies are “receding away
from us” at a speed defined by their redshift. At a rigorous level this is nonsense, what
Wittgenstein would call a “grammatical mistake” — the galaxies are not receding, since the
notion of their velocity with respect to us is not well-defined. What is actually happening
is that the metric of spacetime between us and the galaxies has changed (the universe has
