expanded) along the path of the photon from here to there, leading to an increase in the
wavelength of the light. As an example of how you can go wrong, naive application of the
Doppler formula to the redshift of galaxies implies that some of them are receding faster than
light, in apparent contradiction with relativity. The resolution of this apparent paradox is
simply that the very notion of their recession should not be taken literally.

Enough about what we cannot do; let’s see what we can. Parallel transport is supposed to
be the curved-space generalization of the concept of “keeping the vector constant” as we move
it along a path; similarly for a tensor of arbitrary rank. Given a curve #(\), the requirement
of constancy of a tensor 7" along this curve in flat space is simply % = df—;% = 0. We
therefore define the covariant derivative along the path to be given by an operator

D dx*
—=—V,. 3.30
dx  dx " (3:30)
We then define parallel transport of the tensor 7" along the path x#(\) to be the require-
ment that, along the path,
D HLp2: ks dx®
<5T> v = T =0 (3.31)
This is a well-defined tensor equation, since both the tangent vector da#/dX and the covariant
derivative VT are tensors. This is known as the equation of parallel transport. For a
vector it takes the form
ym e Tye g (3.32)
dA 7P dA R )
We can look at the parallel transport equation as a first-order differential equation defining
an initial-value problem: given a tensor at some point along the path, there will be a unique
continuation of the tensor to other points along the path such that the continuation solves
(3.31). We say that such a tensor is parallel transported.

The notion of parallel transport is obviously dependent on the connection, and different
connections lead to different answers. If the connection is metric-compatible, the metric is
always parallel transported with respect to it:

D dz?
agw = ﬁvag,“, =0. (3.33)
It follows that the inner product of two parallel-transported vectors is preserved. That is, if
V# and WY are parallel-transported along a curve 27()), we have
D D D D
w0V = (L ) VW g (V)W gV ()
= 0. (3.34)
This means that parallel transport with respect to a metric-compatible connection preserves
the norm of vectors, the sense of orthogonality, and so on.
