One thing they don’t usually tell you in GR books is that you can write down an explicit
and general solution to the parallel transport equation, although it’s somewhat formal. First
notice that for some path v : A — 27()), solving the parallel transport equation for a vector
V*# amounts to finding a matrix P*,(\, Xg) which relates the vector at its initial value V*(Xo)
to its value somewhere later down the path:
VE(X) = PF (X, 20)VP(Xo) - (3.35)
Of course the matrix P*,(\, \), known as the parallel propagator, depends on the path
v (although it’s hard to find a notation which indicates this without making v look like an
index). If we define
dx”

Ap(A) = 7ngﬁ ; (3.36)
where the quantities on the right hand side are evaluated at (), then the parallel transport
equation becomes

d
—VH=Ar VP . 3.37
= . (337)
Since the parallel propagator must work for any vector, substituting (3.35) into (3.37) shows
that P",(X, Ag) also obeys this equation:
d pu n o
EP (A Ao) = A¥(N)P? (N Xo) - (3.38)
To solve this equation, first integrate both sides:
A
PryA0) = 3+ [ A% () P70 00 (339)
0
The Kronecker delta, it is easy to see, provides the correct normalization for A = Ag.
We can solve (3.39) by iteration, taking the right hand side and plugging it into itself
repeatedly, giving
A Ao
PHo(X Ao) = 0 + / A* () dn + / / AP () A° () dnfdy + -+ - . (3.40)

The nth term in this series is an integral over an n-dimensional right triangle, or n-simplex.
