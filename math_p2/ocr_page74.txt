It would simplify things if we could consider such an integral to be over an n-cube
instead of an n-simplex; is there some way to do this? There are n! such simplices in each
cube, so we would have to multiply by 1/n! to compensate for this extra volume. But we
also want to get the integrand right; using matrix notation, the integrand at nth order
is A(Nn)A(Mn—1) - -+ A(m), but with the special property that n, > 1,1 > -+ > . We
therefore define the path-ordering symbol, P, to ensure that this condition holds. In
other words, the expression

PLAG) A1) - - - Alm)] (3.41)
stands for the product of the n matrices A(n;), ordered in such a way that the largest value
of n; is on the left, and each subsequent value of 7; is less than or equal to the previous one.

We then can express the nth-order term in (3.40) as

This expression contains no substantive statement about the matrices A(r;); it is just nota-

tion. But we can now write (3.40) in matrix form as
PON) =143 — [ PIAM) ) - A} dn (3.43)

n=1"" 7A0

This formula is just the series expression for an exponential; we therefore say that the parallel

propagator is given by the path-ordered exponential
