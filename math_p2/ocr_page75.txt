where once again this is just notation; the path-ordered exponential is defined to be the right
hand side of (3.43). We can write it more explicitly as

It’s nice to have an explicit formula, even if it is rather abstract. The same kind of ex-
pression appears in quantum field theory as “Dyson’s Formula,” where it arises because the
Schrodinger equation for the time-evolution operator has the same form as (3.38).

As an aside, an especially interesting example of the parallel propagator occurs when the
path is a loop, starting and ending at the same point. Then if the connection is metric-
compatible, the resulting matrix will just be a Lorentz transformation on the tangent space
at the point. This transformation is known as the “holonomy” of the loop. If you know
the holonomy of every possible loop, that turns out to be equivalent to knowing the metric.
This fact has let Ashtekar and his collaborators to examine general relativity in the “loop
representation,” where the fundamental variables are holonomies rather than the explicit
metric. They have made some progress towards quantizing the theory in this approach,
although the jury is still out about how much further progress can be made.

With parallel transport understood, the next logical step is to discuss geodesics. A
geodesic is the curved-space generalization of the notion of a “straight line” in Euclidean
space. We all know what a straight line is: it’s the path of shortest distance between
two points. But there is an equally good definition — a straight line is a path which
parallel transports its own tangent vector. On a manifold with an arbitrary (not necessarily
Christoffel) connection, these two concepts do not quite coincide, and we should discuss
them separately.

We'll take the second definition first, since it is computationally much more straight-
forward. The tangent vector to a path x#(\) is dz*/d\. The condition that it be parallel
transported is thus

This is the geodesic equation, another one which you should memorize. We can easily
see that it reproduces the usual notion of straight lines if the connection coefficients are the
Christoffel symbols in Euclidean space; in that case we can choose Cartesian coordinates in
which I'}, = 0, and the geodesic equation is just d*z# /dN? = 0, which is the equation for a
straight line.

That was embarrassingly simple; let’s turn to the more nontrivial case of the shortest
distance definition. As we know, there are various subtleties involved in the definition of
