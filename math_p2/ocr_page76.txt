3 CURVATURE 69
distance in a Lorentzian spacetime; for null paths the distance is zero, for timelike paths
it’s more convenient to use the proper time, etc. So in the name of simplicity let’s do the
calculation just for a timelike path — the resulting equation will turn out to be good for any
path, so we are not losing any generality. We therefore consider the proper time functional,
dat dzv \
= [ 2) 3.48
i /(g“d/\d/\) (3.48)
where the integral is over the path. To search for shortest-distance paths, we will do the
usual calculus of variations treatment to seek extrema of this functional. (In fact they will
turn out to be curves of mazimum proper time.)
We want to consider the change in the proper time under infinitesimal variations of the
path,

(The second line comes from Taylor expansion in curved spacetime, which as you can see
uses the partial derivative, not the covariant derivative.) Plugging this into (3.48), we get

Since 627 is assumed to be small, we can expand the square root of the expression in square
brackets to find

It is helpful at this point to change the parameterization of our curve from A, which was
arbitrary, to the proper time 7 itself, using
