where in the last line we have integrated by parts, avoiding possible boundary contributions
by demanding that the variation dz vanish at the endpoints of the path. Since we are
searching for stationary points, we want d7 to vanish for any variation; this implies

We see that this is precisely the geodesic equation (3.32), but with the specific choice of
Christoffel connection (3.21). Thus, on a manifold with metric, extremals of the length func-
tional are curves which parallel transport their tangent vector with respect to the Christoffel
connection associated with that metric. It doesn’t matter if there is any other connection
defined on the same manifold. Of course, in GR the Christoffel connection is the only one
which is used, so the two notions are the same.

The primary usefulness of geodesics in general relativity is that they are the paths fol-
lowed by unaccelerated particles. In fact, the geodesic equation can be thought of as the
generalization of Newton’s law f = ma for the case f = 0. It is also possible to introduce
forces by adding terms to the right hand side; in fact, looking back to the expression (1.103)
for the Lorentz force in special relativity, it is tempting to guess that the equation of motion
for a particle of mass m and charge ¢ in general relativity should be

We will talk about this more later, but in fact your guess would be correct.

Having boldly derived these expressions, we should say some more careful words about
the parameterization of a geodesic path. When we presented the geodesic equation as the
requirement that the tangent vector be parallel transported, (3.47), we parameterized our
path with some parameter A, whereas when we found the formula (3.56) for the extremal of
the spacetime interval we wound up with a very specific parameterization, the proper time.
Of course from the form of (3.56) it is clear that a transformation
