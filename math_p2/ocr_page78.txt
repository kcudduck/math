3 CURVATURE 71
for some constants a and b, leaves the equation invariant. Any parameter related to the
proper time in this way is called an affine parameter, and is just as good as the proper
time for parameterizing a geodesic. What was hidden in our derivation of (3.47) was that
the demand that the tangent vector be parallel transported actually constrains the parameter-
ization of the curve, specifically to one related to the proper time by (3.58). In other words,
if you start at some point and with some initial direction, and then construct a curve by
beginning to walk in that direction and keeping your tangent vector parallel transported,
you will not only define a path in the manifold but also (up to linear transformations) define
the parameter along the path.

Of course, there is nothing to stop you from using any other parameterization you like,
but then (3.47) will not be satisfied. More generally you will satisfy an equation of the form

d?at dx? dx® da*

e + Fﬁ”%ﬁ = f(a)m , (3.59)
for some parameter « and some function f(«). Conversely, if (3.59) is satisfied along a curve
you can always find an affine parameter A(«) for which the geodesic equation (3.47) will be
satisfied.

An important property of geodesics in a spacetime with Lorentzian metric is that the
character (timelike/null/spacelike) of the geodesic (relative to a metric-compatible connec-
tion) never changes. This is simply because parallel transport preserves inner products, and
the character is determined by the inner product of the tangent vector with itself. This
is why we were consistent to consider purely timelike paths when we derived (3.56); for
spacelike paths we would have derived the same equation, since the only difference is an
overall minus sign in the final answer. There are also null geodesics, which satisfy the same
equation, except that the proper time cannot be used as a parameter (some set of allowed
parameters will exist, related to each other by linear transformations). You can derive this
fact either from the simple requirement that the tangent vector be parallel transported, or
by extending the variation of (3.48) to include all non-spacelike paths.

Let’s now explain the earlier remark that timelike geodesics are maxima of the proper
time. The reason we know this is true is that, given any timelike curve (geodesic or not), we
can approximate it to arbitrary accuracy by a null curve. To do this all we have to do is to
consider “jagged” null curves which follow the timelike one:
