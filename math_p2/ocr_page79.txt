3 CURVATURE 72
f timelike
_— null

As we increase the number of sharp corners, the null curve comes closer and closer to the
timelike curve while still having zero path length. Timelike geodesics cannot therefore be
curves of minimum proper time, since they are always infinitesimally close to curves of zero
proper time; in fact they maximize the proper time. (This is how you can remember which
twin in the twin paradox ages more — the one who stays home is basically on a geodesic,
and therefore experiences more proper time.) Of course even this is being a little cavalier;
actually every time we say “maximize” or “minimize” we should add the modifier “locally.”
It is often the case that between two points on a manifold there is more than one geodesic.
For instance, on S? we can draw a great circle through any two points, and imagine travelling
between them either the short way or the long way around. One of these is obviously longer
than the other, although both are stationary points of the length functional.

The final fact about geodesics before we move on to curvature proper is their use in
mapping the tangent space at a point p to a local neighborhood of p. To do this we notice
that any geodesic #(\) which passes through p can be specified by its behavior at p; let us
choose the parameter value to be A(p) = 0, and the tangent vector at p to be

dxt
— A =0)=k", 3.60
=)=k, (360)
for k" some vector at p (some element of T),). Then there will be a unique point on the
manifold M which lies on this geodesic where the parameter has the value A = 1. We define
the exponential map at p, exp, : T;, — M, via
exp, (k) =2"(A =1), (3.61)
where a”()) solves the geodesic equation subject to (3.60). For some set of tangent vectors
k* near the zero vector, this map will be well-defined, and in fact invertible. Thus in the
