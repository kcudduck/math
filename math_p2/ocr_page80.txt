neighborhood of p given by the range of the map on this set of tangent vectors, the the
tangent vectors themselves define a coordinate system on the manifold. In this coordinate
system, any geodesic through p is expressed trivially as
aH(\) = Ak* (3.62)
for some appropriate vector k*.

We won’t go into detail about the properties of the exponential map, since in fact we
won’t be using it much, but it’s important to emphasize that the range of the map is not
necessarily the whole manifold, and the domain is not necessarily the whole tangent space.
The range can fail to be all of M simply because there can be two points which are not
connected by any geodesic. (In a Euclidean signature metric this is impossible, but not in
a Lorentzian spacetime.) The domain can fail to be all of T, because a geodesic may run
into a singularity, which we think of as “the edge of the manifold.” Manifolds which have
such singularities are known as geodesically incomplete. This is not merely a problem
for careful mathematicians; in fact the “singularity theorems” of Hawking and Penrose state
that, for reasonable matter content (no negative energies), spacetimes in general relativity
are almost guaranteed to be geodesically incomplete. As examples, the two most useful
spacetimes in GR — the Schwarzschild solution describing black holes and the Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker solutions describing homogeneous, isotropic cosmologies — both feature
important singularities.

Having set up the machinery of parallel transport and covariant derivatives, we are at last
prepared to discuss curvature proper. The curvature is quantified by the Riemann tensor,
which is derived from the connection. The idea behind this measure of curvature is that we
know what we mean by “flatness” of a connection — the conventional (and usually implicit)
Christoffel connection associated with a Euclidean or Minkowskian metric has a number of
properties which can be thought of as different manifestations of flatness. These include the
fact that parallel transport around a closed loop leaves a vector unchanged, that covariant
derivatives of tensors commute, and that initially parallel geodesics remain parallel. As we
