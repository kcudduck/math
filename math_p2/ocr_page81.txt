3 CURVATURE 74
shall see, the Riemann tensor arises when we study how any of these properties are altered
in more general contexts.

We have already argued, using the two-sphere as an example, that parallel transport
of a vector around a closed loop in a curved space will lead to a transformation of the
vector. The resulting transformation depends on the total curvature enclosed by the loop;
it would be more useful to have a local description of the curvature at each point, which is
what the Riemann tensor is supposed to provide. One conventional way to introduce the
Riemann tensor, therefore, is to consider parallel transport around an infinitesimal loop. We
are not going to do that here, but take a more direct route. (Most of the presentations in
the literature are either sloppy, or correct but very difficult to follow.) Nevertheless, even
without working through the details, it is possible to see what form the answer should take.
Imagine that we parallel transport a vector V7 around a closed loop defined by two vectors
AY and B*:

A ©a, b)
(©, 8b)/
BY g BY
A (8a, 0)
0,0)
The (infinitesimal) lengths of the sides of the loop are da and 0b, respectively. Now, we know
the action of parallel transport is independent of coordinates, so there should be some tensor
which tells us how the vector changes when it comes back to its starting point; it will be
a linear transformation on a vector, and therefore involve one upper and one lower index.
But it will also depend on the two vectors A and B which define the loop; therefore there
should be two additional lower indices to contract with A” and B*. Furthermore, the tensor
should be antisymmetric in these two indices, since interchanging the vectors corresponds
to traversing the loop in the opposite direction, and should give the inverse of the original
answer. (This is consistent with the fact that the transformation should vanish if A and B
are the same vector.) We therefore expect that the expression for the change §V# experienced
by this vector when parallel transported around the loop should be of the form

0V* = (da)(6b)A"B*R?,,, V° | (3.63)
where R?;,, is a (1,3) tensor known as the Riemann tensor (or simply “curvature tensor”).
