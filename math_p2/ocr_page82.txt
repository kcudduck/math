3 CURVATURE 75
It is antisymmetric in the last two indices:

Rp(r/u/ = _Rpm/p, . (364)
(Of course, if (3.63) is taken as a definition of the Riemann tensor, there is a convention that
needs to be chosen for the ordering of the indices. There is no agreement at all on what this
convention should be, so be careful.)

Knowing what we do about parallel transport, we could very carefully perform the nec-
essary manipulations to see what happens to the vector under this operation, and the result
would be a formula for the curvature tensor in terms of the connection coefficients. It is much
quicker, however, to consider a related operation, the commutator of two covariant deriva-
tives. The relationship between this and parallel transport around a loop should be evident;
the covariant derivative of a tensor in a certain direction measures how much the tensor
changes relative to what it would have been if it had been parallel transported (since the
covariant derivative of a tensor in a direction along which it is parallel transported is zero).
The commutator of two covariant derivatives, then, measures the difference between parallel
transporting the tensor first one way and then the other, versus the opposite ordering.

The actual computation is very straightforward. Considering a vector field V*, we take

In the last step we have relabeled some dummy indices and eliminated some terms that
cancel when antisymmetrized. We recognize that the last term is simply the torsion tensor,
and that the left hand side is manifestly a tensor; therefore the expression in parentheses
must be a tensor itself. We write
V,, VIVP = R,V =T, V| (3.66)
