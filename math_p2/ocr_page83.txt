3 CURVATURE 76
where the Riemann tensor is identified as

R = 0,X%, — 8,00, + T\I0, — T\, . (3.67)
There are a number of things to notice about the derivation of this expression:

e Of course we have not demonstrated that (3.67) is actually the same tensor that ap-
peared in (3.63), but in fact it’s true (see Wald for a believable if tortuous demonstra-
tion).

o It is perhaps surprising that the commutator [V, V, ], which appears to be a differential
operator, has an action on vector fields which (in the absence of torsion, at any rate)
is a simple multiplicative transformation. The Riemann tensor measures that part of
the commutator of covariant derivatives which is proportional to the vector field, while
the torsion tensor measures the part which is proportional to the covariant derivative
of the vector field; the second derivative doesn’t enter at all.

e Notice that the expression (3.67) is constructed from non-tensorial elements; you can
check that the transformation laws all work out to make this particular combination a
legitimate tensor.

e The antisymmetry of R”,,, in its last two indices is immediate from this formula and
its derivation.

e We constructed the curvature tensor completely from the connection (no mention of
the metric was made). We were sufficiently careful that the above expression is true
for any connection, whether or not it is metric compatible or torsion free.

e Using what are by now our usual methods, the action of [V,, V,] can be computed on
a tensor of arbitrary rank. The answer is

A useful notion is that of the commutator of two vector fields X and Y, which is a third
vector field with components
(X, V)" = X 0 Y* — Y29, X" . (3.69)
Both the torsion tensor and the Riemann tensor, thought of as multilinear maps, have elegant
expressions in terms of the commutator. Thinking of the torsion as a map from two vector
fields to a third vector field, we have
T(X,Y)=VxY -VyX - [X,Y], (3.70)
