3 CURVATURE 77
and thinking of the Riemann tensor as a map from three vector fields to a fourth one, we
have

R(X,Y)Z =VxVyZ -VyVxZ -V xyZ . (3.71)
In these expressions, the notation V x refers to the covariant derivative along the vector field
X; in components, Vy = X#V,. Note that the two vectors X and Y in (3.71) correspond
to the two antisymmetric indices in the component form of the Riemann tensor. The last
term in (3.71), involving the commutator [X,Y’], vanishes when X and Y are taken to be
the coordinate basis vector fields (since [d,,d,] = 0), which is why this term did not arise
when we originally took the commutator of two covariant derivatives. We will not use this
notation extensively, but you might see it in the literature, so you should be able to decode
it.

Having defined the curvature tensor as something which characterizes the connection, let
us now admit that in GR we are most concerned with the Christoffel connection. In this
case the connection is derived from the metric, and the associated curvature may be thought
of as that of the metric itself. This identification allows us to finally make sense of our
informal notion that spaces for which the metric looks Euclidean or Minkowskian are flat.
In fact it works both ways: if the components of the metric are constant in some coordinate
system, the Riemann tensor will vanish, while if the Riemann tensor vanishes we can always
construct a coordinate system in which the metric components are constant.

The first of these is easy to show. If we are in some coordinate system such that 9,g,, = 0
(everywhere, not just at a point), then I, = 0 and 9,I', = 0; thus R’5,, = 0 by (3.67).
But this is a tensor equation, and if it is true in one coordinate system it must be true
in any coordinate system. Therefore, the statement that the Riemann tensor vanishes is a
necessary condition for it to be possible to find coordinates in which the components of g,
are constant everywhere.

It is also a sufficient condition, although we have to work harder to show it. Start by
choosing Riemann normal coordinates at some point p, so that g,, = 1., at p. (Here we
are using 7, in a generalized sense, as a matrix with either +1 or —1 for each diagonal
element and zeroes elsewhere. The actual arrangement of the +1’s and —1’s depends on the
canonical form of the metric, but is irrelevant for the present argument.) Denote the basis
vectors at p by €y, with components é?u)' Then by construction we have

9opll €0y (P) = Ny - (3.72)
Now let us parallel transport the entire set of basis vectors from p to another point g; the
vanishing of the Riemann tensor ensures that the result will be independent of the path taken
between p and ¢. Since parallel transport with respect to a metric compatible connection
preserves inner products, we must have

gnpé(’u)éfy)(q) = Ny - (3.73)
