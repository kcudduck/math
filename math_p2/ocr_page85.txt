3 CURVATURE 78
We therefore have specified a set of vector fields which everywhere define a basis in which
the metric components are constant. This is completely unimpressive; it can be done on any
manifold, regardless of what the curvature is. What we would like to show is that this is
a coordinate basis (which can only be true if the curvature vanishes). We know that if the
€w’s are a coordinate basis, their commutator will vanish:
(e 0] = 0. (3.74)

What we would really like is the converse: that if the commutator vanishes we can find
coordinates y* such that €, = %. In fact this is a true result, known as Frobenius’s
Theorem. It’s something of a mess to prove, involving a good deal more mathematical
apparatus than we have bothered to set up. Let’s just take it for granted (skeptics can
consult Schutz’s Geometrical Methods book). Thus, we would like to demonstrate (3.74) for
the vector fields we have set up. Let’s use the expression (3.70) for the torsion:

e €w)] = Ve o) = Ve e = T(Cw: €0) - (3.75)
The torsion vanishes by hypothesis. The covariant derivatives will also vanish, given the
method by which we constructed our vector fields; they were made by parallel transporting
along arbitrary paths. If the fields are parallel transported along arbitrary paths, they are
certainly parallel transported along the vectors €, and therefore their covariant derivatives
in the direction of these vectors will vanish. Thus (3.70) implies that the commutator
vanishes, and therefore that we can find a coordinate system y* for which these vector fields
are the partial derivatives. In this coordinate system the metric will have components 7,,,
as desired.

The Riemann tensor, with four indices, naively has n' independent components in an
n-dimensional space. In fact the antisymmetry property (3.64) means that there are only
n(n—1)/2 independent values these last two indices can take on, leaving us with n3(n—1)/2
independent components. When we consider the Christoffel connection, however, there are a
number of other symmetries that reduce the independent components further. Let’s consider
these now.

The simplest way to derive these additional symmetries is to examine the Riemann tensor
with all lower indices,

Rpg = gp/\R/\mw . (3.76)
Let us further consider the components of this tensor in Riemann normal coordinates es-
tablished at a point p. Then the Christoffel symbols themselves will vanish, although their
derivatives will not. We therefore have
