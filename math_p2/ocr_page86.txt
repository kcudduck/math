In the second line we have used 9,¢* = 0 in RNC’s, and in the third line the fact that
partials commute. From this expression we can notice immediately two properties of R,y ;
it is antisymmetric in its first two indices,
szr/,w = 7Rzrp/,w 5 (378)
and it is invariant under interchange of the first pair of indices with the second:
Rpa;w = R/,u/pa . (379)
With a little more work, which we leave to your imagination, we can see that the sum of
cyclic permutations of the last three indices vanishes:
Rp(r/u/ + R/)ut/(r + R;}uau =0. (380)
This last property is equivalent to the vanishing of the antisymmetric part of the last three
indices:
Ryfou) =0 . (3.81)
All of these properties have been derived in a special coordinate system, but they are all
tensor equations; therefore they will be true in any coordinates. Not all of them are inde-
pendent; with some effort, you can show that (3.64), (3.78) and (3.81) together imply (3.79).
The logical interdependence of the equations is usually less important than the simple fact
that they are true.

Given these relationships between the different components of the Riemann tensor, how
many independent quantities remain? Let’s begin with the facts that R, is antisymmetric
in the first two indices, antisymmetric in the last two indices, and symmetric under inter-
change of these two pairs. This means that we can think of it as a symmetric matrix R|yo][u),
where the pairs po and pvr are thought of as individual indices. An m x m symmetric ma-
trix has m(m + 1)/2 independent components, while an n X n antisymmetric matrix has
n(n —1)/2 independent components. We therefore have

independent components. We still have to deal with the additional symmetry (3.81). An
immediate consequence of (3.81) is that the totally antisymmetric part of the Riemann tensor
vanishes,
Ripo) =0 . (3.83)
