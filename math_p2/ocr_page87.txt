In fact, this equation plus the other symmetries (3.64), (3.78) and (3.79) are enough to imply
(3.81), as can be easily shown by expanding (3.83) and messing with the resulting terms.
Therefore imposing the additional constraint of (3.83) is equivalent to imposing (3.81), once
the other symmetries have been accounted for. How many independent restrictions does this
represent? Let us imagine decomposing
szr/,w = Xpﬂ;u/ + R[pzr/,w] . (384)

It is easy to see that any totally antisymmetric 4-index tensor is automatically antisymmetric
in its first and last indices, and symmetric under interchange of the two pairs. Therefore
these properties are independent restrictions on X, unrelated to the requirement (3.83).
Now a totally antisymmetric 4-index tensor has n(n—1)(n—2)(n—3)/4! terms, and therefore
(3.83) reduces the number of independent components by this amount. We are left with

1 . ; 1 1 .

—(n* =20 +3n% = 2n) — —n(n —1)(n —2)(n — 3) = —=n*(n*-1) (3.85)

independent components of the Riemann tensor.

In four dimensions, therefore, the Riemann tensor has 20 independent components. (In
one dimension it has none.) These twenty functions are precisely the 20 degrees of freedom
in the second derivatives of the metric which we could not set to zero by a clever choice of
coordinates. This should reinforce your confidence that the Riemann tensor is an appropriate
measure of curvature.

In addition to the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensor (which constrain the
number of independent components at any point), there is a differential identity which
it obeys (which constrains its relative values at different points). Consider the covariant
derivative of the Riemann tensor, evaluated in Riemann normal coordinates:

vARp(r/u/ = ?/\Rpa;w

We would like to consider the sum of cyclic permutations of the first three indices:

+aaauapg>\u - aaauakgup - aaauapg/\u + aaauakgup)
= 0. (3.87)
Once again, since this is an equation between tensors it is true in any coordinate system,
even though we derived it in a particular one. We recognize by now that the antisymmetry
