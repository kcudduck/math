3 CURVATURE 81
Ryopy = —Rgpu allows us to write this result as
V[)\RPU]W =0. (3.88)
This is known as the Bianchi identity. (Notice that for a general connection there would
be additional terms involving the torsion tensor.) It is closely related to the Jacobi identity,
since (as you can show) it basically expresses
(VA Vo). Vol + [V, Vo, VAl +[[Ve, VA, V, ] = 0. (3.89)
It is frequently useful to consider contractions of the Riemann tensor. Even without the
metric, we can form a contraction known as the Ricci tensor:
Notice that, for the curvature tensor formed from an arbitrary (not necessarily Christoffel)
connection, there are a number of independent contractions to take. Our primary concern is
with the Christoffel connection, for which (3.90) is the only independent contraction (modulo
conventions for the sign, which of course change from place to place). The Ricci tensor
associated with the Christoffel connection is symmetric,

R;w = Rl/u B} (391)
as a consequence of the various symmetries of the Riemann tensor. Using the metric, we can
take a further contraction to form the Ricci scalar:

R=R')=g"R,, . (3.92)
An especially useful form of the Bianchi identity comes from contracting twice on (3.87):
0 = g””gu/\(kapvuu + vaaAuu + VURAp;w)
= V"R,,—V,R+V"R,, , (3.93)
or 1

VR, = EV[,R . (3.94)
(Notice that, unlike the partial derivative, it makes sense to raise an index on the covariant

derivative, due to metric compatibility.) If we define the Einstein tensor as

1

G = Ry — ing , (3.95)

then we see that the twice-contracted Bianchi identity (3.94) is equivalent to

VG =0. (3.96)
