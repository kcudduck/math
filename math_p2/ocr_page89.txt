3 CURVATURE 82
The Einstein tensor, which is symmetric due to the symmetry of the Ricci tensor and the
metric, will be of great importance in general relativity.

The Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar contain information about “traces” of the Riemann
tensor. It is sometimes useful to consider separately those pieces of the Riemann tensor
which the Ricci tensor doesn’t tell us about. We therefore invent the Weyl tensor, which is
basically the Riemann tensor with all of its contractions removed. It is given in n dimensions
by

Coopr = Rpopw — m (gp[uRu]a - ga[uRu]p) + ngp[MJV]U : (3.97)
This messy formula is designed so that all possible contractions of C,,,, vanish, while it
retains the symmetries of the Riemann tensor:
Coowr = Clpolju] »
Opauu = Ow/po' 3
Coloy = 0. (3.98)
The Weyl tensor is only defined in three or more dimensions, and in three dimensions it
vanishes identically. For n > 4 it satisfies a version of the Bianchi identity,
VPC oo = *2% (V[#Ry]g + ﬁgg[yvﬂ]ﬁf) . (3.99)
One of the most important properties of the Weyl tensor is that it is invariant under confor-
mal transformations. This means that if you compute C),,,, for some metric g,,,, and then
compute it again for a metric given by Q*(z)g,.,, where Q(z) is an arbitrary nonvanishing
function of spacetime, you get the same answer. For this reason it is often known as the
“conformal tensor.”

After this large amount of formalism, it might be time to step back and think about what
curvature means for some simple examples. First notice that, according to (3.85),in 1, 2, 3
and 4 dimensions there are 0, 1, 6 and 20 components of the curvature tensor, respectively.
(Everything we say about the curvature in these examples refers to the curvature associated
with the Christoffel connection, and therefore the metric.) This means that one-dimensional
manifolds (such as S') are never curved; the intuition you have that tells you that a circle is
curved comes from thinking of it embedded in a certain flat two-dimensional plane. (There is
something called “extrinsic curvature,” which characterizes the way something is embedded
in a higher dimensional space. Our notion of curvature is “intrinsic,” and has nothing to do
with such embeddings.)

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic curvature is also important in two dimen-
sions, where the curvature has one independent component. (In fact, all of the information
