3 CURVATURE 83
about the curvature is contained in the single component of the Ricci scalar.) Consider a
cylinder, R x S'. Although this looks curved from our point of view, it should be clear
that we can put a metric on the cylinder whose components are constant in an appropriate
coordinate system — simply unroll it and use the induced metric from the plane. In this
metric, the cylinder is flat. (There is also nothing to stop us from introducing a different
metric in which the cylinder is not flat, but the point we are trying to emphasize is that it
can be made flat in some metric.) The same story holds for the torus:
I

We can think of the torus as a square region of the plane with opposite sides identified (in
other words, S' x S1), from which it is clear that it can have a flat metric even though it
looks curved from the embedded point of view.

A cone is an example of a two-dimensional manifold with nonzero curvature at exactly
one point. We can see this also by unrolling it; the cone is equivalent to the plane with a
“deficit angle” removed and opposite sides identified:
