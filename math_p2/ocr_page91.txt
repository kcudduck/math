In the metric inherited from this description as part of the flat plane, the cone is flat every-
where but at its vertex. This can be seen by considering parallel transport of a vector around
various loops; if a loop does not enclose the vertex, there will be no overall transformation,
whereas a loop that does enclose the vertex (say, just one time) will lead to a rotation by an
angle which is just the deficit angle.
Our favorite example is of course the two-sphere, with metric
ds? = a®(d6* +sin? 0 dg?) , (3.100)
where a is the radius of the sphere (thought of as embedded in R?). Without going through
the details, the nonzero connection coefficients are
Fio = —sinfcosf
Iy, =T% = cotf. (3.101)
Let’s compute a promising component of the Riemann tensor:
o 0 9 0 A 0 A
Ry = 0ggs — Ol + a5y — Tgalgy
