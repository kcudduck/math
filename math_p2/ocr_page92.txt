(The notation is obviously imperfect, since the Greek letter A is a dummy index which is
summed over, while the Greek letters 6 and ¢ represent specific coordinates.) Lowering an
index, we have
Rosos = goaRs00

= a%sin?6 . (3.103)
It is easy to check that all of the components of the Riemann tensor either vanish or are
related to this one by symmetry. We can go on to compute the Ricci tensor via R, =
9°® Roypu. We obtain
Ryg = g"Ryppo =1
Rgy = Ryp=0
Rri)ri) = gogR.q(i,gg/) = Si112 0. (3104)
The Ricci scalar is similarly straightforward:

R =g"Ryg + 9% Ry = o (3.105)
Therefore the Ricci scalar, which for a two-dimensional manifold completely characterizes
the curvature, is a constant over this two-sphere. This is a reflection of the fact that the
manifold is “maximally symmetric,” a concept we will define more precisely later (although it
means what you think it should). In any number of dimensions the curvature of a maximally
symmetric space satisfies (for some constant a)
szr/,w = a72(gp;¢gm/ - gpvgﬂp) 5 (3106)
which you may check is satisfied by this example.

Notice that the Ricci scalar is not only constant for the two-sphere, it is manifestly
positive. We say that the sphere is “positively curved” (of course a convention or two came
into play, but fortunately our conventions conspired so that spaces which everyone agrees
to call positively curved actually have a positive Ricci scalar). From the point of view of
someone living on a manifold which is embedded in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space,
if they are sitting at a point of positive curvature the space curves away from them in the
same way in any direction, while in a negatively curved space it curves away in opposite
directions. Negatively curved spaces are therefore saddle-like.

Enough fun with examples. There is one more topic we have to cover before introducing
general relativity itself: geodesic deviation. You have undoubtedly heard that the defining
