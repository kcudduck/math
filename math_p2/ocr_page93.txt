property of Euclidean (flat) geometry is the parallel postulate: initially parallel lines remain
parallel forever. Of course in a curved space this is not true; on a sphere, certainly, initially
parallel geodesics will eventually cross. We would like to quantify this behavior for an
arbitrary curved space.

The problem is that the notion of “parallel” does not extend naturally from flat to curved
spaces. Instead what we will do is to construct a one-parameter family of geodesics, 7;(t).
That is, for each s € R, 7, is a geodesic parameterized by the affine parameter ¢. The
collection of these curves defines a smooth two-dimensional surface (embedded in a manifold
M of arbitrary dimensionality). The coordinates on this surface may be chosen to be s and
t, provided we have chosen a family of geodesics which do not cross. The entire surface is
the set of points a#(s,t) € M. We have two natural vector fields: the tangent vectors to the
geodesics,

Ozt
T = —, 3.107
and the “deviation vectors”
St = 9u" (3.108)
T 0s ’
This name derives from the informal notion that S* points from one geodesic towards the
neighboring ones.

The idea that S* points from one geodesic to the next inspires us to define the “relative
velocity of geodesics,”

VH = (VpS)F =T°V,S* (3.109)
and the “relative acceleration of geodesics,”

a* = (VeV)F =TV, VH . (3.110)
You should take the names with a grain of salt, but these vectors are certainly well-defined.
