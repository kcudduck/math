Since S and T are basis vectors adapted to a coordinate system, their commutator van-
ishes:
[S,T]=0.
We would like to consider the conventional case where the torsion vanishes, so from (3.70)
we then have
SV, TH =TV ,5" . (3.111)
‘With this in mind, let’s compute the acceleration:
a* = TV, (T°V,S")
= T°V,(5°V,T")
= (T'V,S%)(V,T") +TrS5°V Vv, T+
= (S*V,T7)(V,T") +Tr5°(V,V,T" + R, ,,T")
= (S°V,T7)(V,TH) + SV (T*V,T") — (S°V,T°)V,T" + R",,, T'T* S’
= RM',T'TPS? . (3.112)
Let’s think about this line by line. The first line is the definition of a*, and the second
line comes directly from (3.111). The third line is simply the Leibniz rule. The fourth
line replaces a double covariant derivative by the derivatives in the opposite order plus the
Riemann tensor. In the fifth line we use Leibniz again (in the opposite order from usual),
and then we cancel two identical terms and notice that the term involving 77V, T* vanishes
because T* is the tangent vector to a geodesic. The result,
