3 CURVATURE 88
is known as the geodesic deviation equation. It expresses something that we might have
expected: the relative acceleration between two neighboring geodesics is proportional to the
curvature.

Physically, of course, the acceleration of neighboring geodesics is interpreted as a mani-
festation of gravitational tidal forces. This reminds us that we are very close to doing physics
by now.

There is one last piece of formalism which it would be nice to cover before we move
on to gravitation proper. What we will do is to consider once again (although much more
concisely) the formalism of connections and curvature, but this time we will use sets of basis
vectors in the tangent space which are not derived from any coordinate system. It will turn
out that this slight change in emphasis reveals a different point of view on the connection
and curvature, one in which the relationship to gauge theories in particle physics is much
more transparent. In fact the concepts to be introduced are very straightforward, but the
subject is a notational nightmare, so it looks more difficult than it really is.

Up until now we have been taking advantage of the fact that a natural basis for the
tangent space T}, at a point p is given by the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates
at that point, é(,) = 0. SimiAlarly, a basis for the cotangent space T} is given by the gradients
of the coordinate functions, §*) = dz*. There is nothing to stop us, however, from setting up
any bases we like. Let us therefore imagine that at each point in the manifold we introduce
a set of basis vectors é(,) (indexed by a Latin letter rather than Greek, to remind us that
they are not related to any coordinate system). We will choose these basis vectors to be
“orthonormal”, in a sense which is appropriate to the signature of the manifold we are
working on. That is, if the canonical form of the metric is written 7,,, we demand that the
inner product of our basis vectors be

where g(, ) is the usual metric tensor. Thus, in a Lorentzian spacetime 7, represents
the Minkowski metric, while in a space with positive-definite metric it would represent the
Euclidean metric. The set of vectors comprising an orthonormal basis is sometimes known
as a tetrad (from Greek tetras, “a group of four”) or vielbein (from the German for “many
legs”). In different numbers of dimensions it occasionally becomes a vierbein (four), dreibein
(three), zweibein (two), and so on. (Just as we cannot in general find coordinate charts which
cover the entire manifold, we will often not be able to find a single set of smooth basis vector
fields which are defined everywhere. As usual, we can overcome this problem by working in
different patches and making sure things are well-behaved on the overlaps.)

The point of having a basis is that any vector can be expressed as a linear combination
of basis vectors. Specifically, we can express our old basis vectors é(,) = J, in terms of the
