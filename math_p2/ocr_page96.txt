new ones:
é(#) = eﬁé(a) . (3115)
The components €}, form an n X n invertible matrix. (In accord with our usual practice of
blurring the distinction between objects and their components, we will refer to the e}, as
the tetrad or vielbein, and often in the plural as “vielbeins.”) We denote their inverse by
switching indices to obtain e#, which satisfy
elel =1 | eney =0y . (3.116)
These serve as the components of the vectors €(,y in the coordinate basis:
In terms of the inverse vielbeins, (3.114) becomes
Guv€a €y = Tab » (3.118)
or equivalently
G = 626';77,11; . (3.119)
This last equation sometimes leads people to say that the vielbeins are the “square root” of
the metric.
We can similarly set up an orthonormal basis of one-forms in 77, which we denote @,
They may be chosen to be compatible with the basis vectors, in the sense that
09 (e) = o8 . (3.120)
It is an immediate consequence of this that the orthonormal one-forms are related to their
coordinate-based cousins #*) = dz# by
oW = 1@ (3.121)
and
0@ = esg® (3.122)
The vielbeins e thus serve double duty as the components of the coordinate basis vectors
in terms of the orthonormal basis vectors, and as components of the orthonormal basis
one-forms in terms of the coordinate basis one-forms; while the inverse vielbeins serve as
the components of the orthonormal basis vectors in terms of the coordinate basis, and as
components of the coordinate basis one-forms in terms of the orthonormal basis.
Any other vector can be expressed in terms of its components in the orthonormal basis.
If a vector V' is written in the coordinate basis as V#é(,) and in the orthonormal basis as
V% (a), the sets of components will be related by
Ve =e Vi, (3.123)
