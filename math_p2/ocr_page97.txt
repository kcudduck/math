3 CURVATURE 90
So the vielbeins allow us to “switch from Latin to Greek indices and back.” The nice property
of tensors, that there is usually only one sensible thing to do based on index placement, is
of great help here. We can go on to refer to multi-index tensors in either basis, or even in
terms of mixed components:

Ve, = eZV“b =gV =eeVFh, . (3.124)
Looking back at (3.118), we see that the components of the metric tensor in the orthonormal
basis are just those of the flat metric, 4. (For this reason the Greek indices are sometimes
referred to as “curved” and the Latin ones as “flat.”) In fact we can go so far as to raise and
lower the Latin indices using the flat metric and its inverse n?. You can check for yourself
that everything works okay (e.g., that the lowering an index with the metric commutes with
changing from orthonormal to coordinate bases).

By introducing a new set of basis vectors and one-forms, we necessitate a return to our
favorite topic of transformation properties. We’ve been careful all along to emphasize that
the tensor transformation law was only an indirect outcome of a coordinate transformation;
the real issue was a change of basis. Now that we have non-coordinate bases, these bases can
be changed independently of the coordinates. The only restriction is that the orthonormality
property (3.114) be preserved. But we know what kind of transformations preserve the flat
metric — in a Euclidean signature metric they are orthogonal transformations, while in a
Lorentzian signature metric they are Lorentz transformations. We therefore consider changes
of basis of the form

é(a) - é(a’) = Aa’a(z)é(a) ’ (3'125)
where the matrices Ay %(x) represent position-dependent transformations which (at each
point) leave the canonical form of the metric unaltered:

In fact these matrices correspond to what in flat space we called the inverse Lorentz trans-
formations (which operate on basis vectors); as before we also have ordinary Lorentz trans-
formations A%, which transform the basis one-forms. As far as components are concerned,
as before we transform upper indices with A”, and lower indices with Ay

So we now have the freedom to perform a Lorentz transformation (or an ordinary Eu-
clidean rotation, depending on the signature) at every point in space. These transformations
are therefore called local Lorentz transformations, or LLT’s. We still have our usual
freedom to make changes in coordinates, which are called general coordinate trans-
formations, or GCT’s. Both can happen at the same time, resulting in a mixed tensor
transformation law: o ,
