3 CURVATURE 91
Translating what we know about tensors into non-coordinate bases is for the most part
merely a matter of sticking vielbeins in the right places. The crucial exception comes when
we begin to differentiate things. In our ordinary formalism, the covariant derivative of a
tensor is given by its partial derivative plus correction terms, one for each index, involving
the tensor and the connection coefficients. The same procedure will continue to be true
for the non-coordinate basis, but we replace the ordinary connection coefficients FIAW by the
spin connection, denoted w,",. Each Latin index gets a factor of the spin connection in
the usual way:
VuX“b = (()uXab + wuacX”b — w‘be“C . (3128)
(The name “spin connection” comes from the fact that this can be used to take covari-
ant derivatives of spinors, which is actually impossible using the conventional connection
coefficients.) In the presence of mixed Latin and Greek indices we get terms of both kinds.
The usual demand that a tensor be independent of the way it is written allows us to
derive a relationship between the spin connection, the vielbeins, and the I'/\’s. Consider the
covariant derivative of a vector X, first in a purely coordinate basis:
VX = (V,X")dz* ®0,
= (O X"+ T XNdat ® 0, . (3.129)
Now find the same object in a mixed basis, and convert into the coordinate basis:
VX = (VNX“)dx“ ® é(a)
= (0.X" + w, X )da" ® éa)
= (0,(e2X") + w, A X M) dat @ (e50,)
= e7(e%0, X" + X 0,e" + w, el XN)da" ® 9,
= (0, X"+ €20,e5X* + etehw, WX ) dat ® 0, . (3.130)
Comparison with (3.129) reveals
Ty = enduel + evebw, % (3.131)
or equivalently
W, = eﬁeifz)‘ — ep0,es . (3.132)
A bit of manipulation allows us to write this relation as the vanishing of the covariant
derivative of the vielbein,
Ve, =0, (3.133)
which is sometimes known as the “tetrad postulate.” Note that this is always true; we did
not need to assume anything about the connection in order to derive it. Specifically, we did
not need to assume that the connection was metric compatible or torsion free.
