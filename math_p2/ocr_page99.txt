3 CURVATURE 92
Since the connection may be thought of as something we need to fix up the transformation
law of the covariant derivative, it should come as no surprise that the spin connection does
not itself obey the tensor transformation law. Actually, under GCT’s the one lower Greek
index does transform in the right way, as a one-form. But under LLT’s the spin connection
transforms inhomogeneously, as
wua/b/ = Aa/aA),rwa‘,ab — Ab/“(?HA"/“ . (3134)
You are encouraged to check for yourself that this results in the proper transformation of
the covariant derivative.

So far we have done nothing but empty formalism, translating things we already knew
into a new notation. But the work we are doing does buy us two things. The first, which
we already alluded to, is the ability to describe spinor fields on spacetime and take their
covariant derivatives; we won’t explore this further right now. The second is a change in
viewpoint, in which we can think of various tensors as tensor-valued differential forms. For
example, an object like X%, which we think of as a (1, 1) tensor written with mixed indices,
can also be thought of as a “vector-valued one-form.” It has one lower Greek index, so we
think of it as a one-form, but for each value of the lower index it is a vector. Similarly a
tensor A,,%, antisymmetric in p and v, can be thought of as a “(1,1)-tensor-valued two-
form.” Thus, any tensor with some number of antisymmetric lower Greek indices and some
number of Latin indices can be thought of as a differential form, but taking values in the
tensor bundle. (Ordinary differential forms are simply scalar-valued forms.) The usefulness
of this viewpoint comes when we consider exterior derivatives. If we want to think of X,*
as a vector-valued one-form, we are tempted to take its exterior derivative:

(dX)w® =0, X, — 0, X, . (3.135)
It is easy to check that this object transforms like a two-form (that is, according to the
transformation law for (0,2) tensors) under GCT’s, but not as a vector under LLT’s (the
Lorentz transformations depend on position, which introduces an inhomogeneous term into
the transformation law). But we can fix this by judicious use of the spin connection, which
can be thought of as a one-form. (Not a tensor-valued one-form, due to the nontensorial
transformation law (3.134).) Thus, the object
(AX)w® + WA X)w® = 0,X," — 0, X, + w, X, — w, B X" (3.136)
as you can verify at home, transforms as a proper tensor.

An immediate application of this formalism is to the expressions for the torsion and
curvature, the two tensors which characterize any given connection. The torsion, with two
antisymmetric lower indices, can be thought of as a vector-valued two-form 7),,%. The
