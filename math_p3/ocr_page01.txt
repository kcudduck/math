ABSTRACT. In the last 40 years the study of initial boundary value problem for the Korteweg-de Vries equation
has had the attention of researchers from various research fields. In this note we present a review of the main
results about this topic and also introduce interesting open problems which still requires attention from the
mathematical point of view.
