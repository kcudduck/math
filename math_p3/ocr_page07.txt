IBVP OF THE KDV 7

The corresponding solution map 7 — u will be called the boundary integral operator denoted by “//b(dk,) .

An explicit representation formula is given for this boundary integral operator that plays an important role

in showing the solution of the IBVP (3.14) possesses the smoothing properties. The needed smoothing

properties for solutions of the IBVP (3.12) will then follow from the smoothing properties for solutions of

the IBVP (3.14) and the well-known sharp Kato smoothing properties for solutions of the Cauchy problem
U+t + Ou=0, ux0)=wykx), xteck

Finally, the following comments are now given in order:
Remark 1. The temporal regularity conditions imposed on the boundary values T on Theorem ¥ are optimal
(cf. [4,6,7]).
Remark 2. As a comparison, note that the assumptions of Theorem .7 are equivalent to one of the following
boundary conditions imposed on the equation in (2.4):

a)

u(0,0) =0, u(l,t)=0, u(l,t)=0;
b)
U (0,7) +aue(0,2) +bu(0,1) =0,  u(1,6) =0, u(l,t)=0

with
(3.15) a>b*/2;

)

u(0,) =0, wup(1,0) +aue(1,0)+bu(l,t) =0, uy(1,7)+cu(l,z) =0,

with
(3.16) ac>b—c?/2;

d)

e (0,1) + arux(0,1) + au(0,1) = 0,
e (1,1) + brue(1,1) + bou(1,1) =0,
and
ue(1,1) +cu(l,1) =0,
with
(3.17) ay>d})2, bic>by—c%)2.
It follows from Theorem ¥ that conditions (3.15), (3.16) and (3.17) for Theorem <7 can be removed.
4. OPEN PROBLEMS

While the results reported in this paper gave a significant improvement in the theory of initial boundary
value problems of the KdV equation on a finite interval, there are still many questions to be addressed for
the following IBVP:

Uy + Uy + U+t =0, 0<x<L,t>0,
(4.18) u(x,0) = ¢ (x),
Bru = h.
Here we list a few of them which are most interesting to us.
o Is the IBVP (4.18) globally well-posed in the space H*(0,L) for some s > 0 or equivalently, does any
solution of the IBVP (4.18) blow up in the some space H*(0,L) in finite time?

It is not clear if the IBVP (4.18) is globally well-posed or not even in the case of 7= 0. It follows
Theorem ¥ (see [18]) that a solution u of the IBVP (4.18) blows up in the space H*(0,L) for some s > 0 at
a finite time 7' > 0 if and only if

lim [Ju(-,2)[l120,0) = +oo-
