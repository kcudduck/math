Consequently, it suffices to establish a global a priori L?(0,L) estimate
(4.19) sup [lu(-,1)||r2(0,) < 4o,
0<t<oo

for solutions of the IBVP (4.18) in order to obtain the global well-posedness of the IBVP (4.18) in the space
H*(0,L) for any s > 0. However, estimate (4.19) is known to be held only in one case

Uy + Uy + Uty + Uy = f, O<x<L,t>0

u(x,0) = ¢(x)

u(0,1) = hy (1), u(L,t) = hy(t), uy(L,t) = h3(1).
o Is the IBVP well-posed in the space H*(0,L) for some s < —1?

Theorem ¢ ensures that the IBVP (4.18) is locally well-posed in the space H*(0,L) for any s > 0.
Theorem ¢ can also be extended to the case of —1 < s < 0 using the same approach developed in [8]. For
the pure initial value problems (IVP) of the KdV equation posed on the whole line R or on torus T,

(4.20) U+ Uty + Uy =0, u(x,0)=¢(x), x,teR
and
4.21) U+ Uty + Uy =0, u(x,0) =¢(x), xeT,teR,
it is well-known that the IVP (4.20) is well-posed in the space H*(RR) for any s > —% and is (conditionally)
ill-posed in the space H*(R) for any s < — % in the sense the corresponding solution map cannot be uniformly
continuous. As for the IVP (4.21), it is well-posed in the space H*(T) for any s > —1. The solution
map corresponding to the IVP (4.21) is real analytic when s > 7%, but only continuous (not even locally
uniformly continuous) when —1 <s < —%. Whether the IVP (4.20) is well-posed in the space H*(RR) for
any s < —% or the IVP (4.21) is well-posed in the space H*(T) for any s < —1 is still an open question. On
the other hand, by contrast, the IVP of the KdV-Burgers equation

Up + Uty + Uy — Uy =0, u(x,0)=0¢(x), xeR, >0
is known to be well-posed in the space H*(R) for any s > —1, but is known to be ill-posed for any s < —1.
We conjecture that the IBVP (4.18) is ill-posed in the space H*(0,L) for any s < —1.

Finally, still concerning with well-posedness problem, while the approach developed recently in [18]
studies the nonhomogeneous boundary value problems of the KdV equation on (0,L) with quite general
boundary conditions, there are still some boundary value problems of the KdV equation that the approach
do not work, for example

Uy + Uty + e =0, x€(0,L)
(4.22) u(x,0) = ¢(x),

u(0,1) = u(L,1), uc(0,¢) = uy(L,t), e (0,¢) = uyr(L,1)
and

Uy + Uty + e =0, x€(0,L),
(4.23) u(x,0) = ¢(x),
u(0,1) =0, u(L,t) =0, ue(0,7) = uy(L,1).
A common feature for these two boundary value problems is that the L>—norm of their solutions are con-
served:
L L
/ WP (x,1)dx = / 0% (x)dx for any r € R.
0 0

The IBVP (4.22) is equivalent to the IVP (4.21) which was shown by Kato [38, 39] to be well-posed in the
space H*(T) when s > % as early as in the late 1970s. Its well-posedness in the space H*(T) when s < % s
