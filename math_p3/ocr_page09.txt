IBVP OF THE KDV 9
however, was established 24 years later in the celebrated work of Bourgain [9, 10] in 1993. As for the IBVP
(4.23), its associated linear problem

U+ =0, x€(0,L),
u(x,0) = ¢(x),u(0,1) =0,
u(L,t) =0, uy(0,1) = uy(L,t)
has been shown by Cerpa (see, for instance, [20]) to be well-posed in the space H*(0,L) forward and
backward in time. However, the following problem is still unknown:

4.1. Control theory. Control theory for KdV equation has been extensively studied in the past two decades
and the interested reader is referred to [20] for an overall view of the subject. As it is possible to see in the
paper above, several authors have addressed the study of control theory of the IBVP (see, e.g, [17, 22, 52]),
who worked on the following four problems related to the IBVP (4.18):
u(0,6) =hy (1), >0, u(0,1) =h12(t), >0,
Biov:=S u(L,t) =hy1(t), t>0, PBorov:=quc(Lt)=hy(t), >0,
uy(L,t) =h3 (1), t>0, Uy (L,t) =h32(1), >0,
e (0,1) =hy13(t) >0, Uy (0,1) = hy4(t), t>0,
PByou:=qu(L,t) =hy3(t), >0, Baou:=qu(L,t)=hys(t), t>0,
uy(L,t) =h33(t), t>0 e (L,t) = h34(r), t>0.

The first class of problem (4.18)-% ov was studied by Rosier [52] considering only the control input
h3; (i.e. by = hy; = 0). It was shown in [52] that the exact controllability of the linearized system holds
in L? (0,L) if and only if, L does not belong to the following countable set of critical lengths

The analysis developed in [52] shows that when the linearized system is controllable, the same is true for
the nonlinear case. Note that the converse is false, as it was proved in [19, 21, 27], that is, the (nonlinear)
KdV equation is controllable even when L is a critical length but the linearized system is non controllable.

The existence of a discrete set of critical lengths for which the exact controllability of the linearized
equation fails was also noticed by Glass and Guerrero in [35] when A, is taken as control input (i.e.
hy1 = hz; = 0). Finally, it is worth mentioning the result by Rosier [53] and Glass and Guerrero [34] for
which £ ; is taken as control input (i.e. i1 = h3; = 0). They proved that system (4.18) with boundary
conditions % ov is then null controllable, but not exactly controllable, because of the strong smoothing
effect.

Recently, Cerpa et al. in [22] proved similar results to those obtained by Rosier [52] for the system
(4.18) with boundary conditions %, gv. More precisely, the authors consider the system with one, two or
three controls. In addition, using the well-posedness properties proved by Kramer et al. in [48], they also
proved that the controls /;», i = 1,2,3 belong to sharp spaces and the locally exact controllability of the
linear system associated to (4.18) holds if, and only if, L does not belong to the following countable set of
critical lengths

Moreover, they showed that the nonlinear system (4.18) with boundary conditions %, gv is locally exactly
controllable via the contraction mapping principle.

Recently, Caicedo et al., in [17], proved the controllability results for the system (2.9), that is, system
(4.18) with boundary conditions A4 ov. Naturally, they used the same approaches that have worked effec-
tively for system (4.18) with boundary condition % gv and %, gv. In particular, if only A 4(r) is used, they
