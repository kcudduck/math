ON THE MULTI-SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURE OF THE
SERRE—GREEN—INAGHDI EQUATIONS
MARX CHHAY, DENYS DUTYKH*, AND DIDIER CLAMOND
ABSTRACT. In this short note, we present a multi-symplectic structure of the Serre—
Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations modelling nonlinear long surface waves in shallow water.
This multi-symplectic structure allow the use of efficient finite difference or pseudo-spectral
numerical schemes preserving ezactly the multi-symplectic form at the discrete level.
Key words and phrases: fully nonlinear long waves; Serre equations; Green-Naghdi
model; multi-symplectic structure
