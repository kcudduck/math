1. Introduction

The present manuscript is devoted to a further study of the celebrated Serre-Green—
Naghdi model of fully nonlinear long water waves propagating in shallow water. Namely,
we unveil another variational structure of these equations. The Hamiltonian formulation
for the Serre equations can be found, for example, in [16]. However, this structure is non-
canonical and highly non-trivial, at least at the first sight. In this article, we propose a
multi-symplectic structure for the same system of Serre equations. The multi-symplectic
structure generalises the classical Hamiltonian formulations [2] to the case of Partial Dif-
ferential Equations (PDEs) such that the space and time variables are treated on the equal
footing [5] (see also |19, Chapter 12]).

Let us recall some basic facts about the Serre equations in 2D (one horizontal dimen-
sion). Assuming that derivatives are ‘small’ (i.e., long waves in shallow water) but finite
amplitudes,™ Serre [24, 25| derived the system of equations

he + O.[hu] = 0, (1.1)
up + uuy + ghy + %h’lﬁl[h2~/] = 0, (1.2)
where
vy = h[u_,f—uzt—uumL (1.3)
is the fluid vertical acceleration at the free surface. In these equations, x is the horizontal
coordinate, t is the time, u is the depth-averaged horizontal velocity and h is the total
water depth (bottom to free surface). A sketch of the domain is shown in Figure 1.

These equations were independently rediscovered later by Su and Gardner [27] and again
by Green, Laws and Naghdi [15]. These approximations being valid in shallow water
without assuming small amplitude waves, they are sometimes called weakly-dispersive fully-
nonlinear approzimation [30] and are a generalisation of the Saint-Venant [26, 29| and of
the Boussinesq equations [3, 11|. The derivations above are straightforward, one can refer
to [18], for example.

*1It should be noted that the steady version of these equations were derived earlier by Rayleigh [20].
