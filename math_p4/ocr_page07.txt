For the Serre equations, from the results of the previous section, we have
E = grhy = thre + $0¢ = 3qda — 5gh* + $hu® - Fho?,
F = %hrt - érht + %LIOt - %@LIm
G = %I)ht - %hpf, + %(/bhf, - %h(/ﬁ,, - %gh2 + %h,u2 - éhvz.
and using the relations (2.5)-(2.12), after some algebra, one gets the expression of quantities
E, F, G and [ in initial physical variables
-E = %hu2 + %gh2 + %hQUf - 81[%(bhu + éh31LU1:|,
-F = (3w + 1R2ul+ gh+ thy)hu + O Sohu + thPuu, ],
G = hu? + $gh* + 1hPy + 9[Loh + LhPu, ],
I = hu - BJ;[%(]M, + éh,a’uw].
So the momentum and energy conservation equations (1.4) and (1.5) are recovered, though
-E, -F, G and [ are not exactly the densities of energy, energy flux, momentum flux and
impulse, respectively.
4. Discussion

In the present manuscript, we discussed the multi-symplectic structure for the Serre
equations, which is a very popular model nowadays for long waves in shallow waters. To
our knowledge it is the first time that such a structure is reported in the literature. A
non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the Serre equations can be found, for example, in
[16]. However, we find that the corresponding multi-symplectic structure is simpler and
more natural for these equations. Moreover, it allows to treat on the equal footing the
space and time variables [21]. The advantages of this formulation are well-known [5].

The multi-symplectic structure of the exact water wave equations being already known
[5], it seems natural that approximate equations also have a multi-symplectic structure.
However, Serre’s equations being not exactly irrotational, it is not obvious a priori that
such a multi-symplectic structure should indeed exists. It is not at all trivial to obtain
this structure directly from the Serre equations (1.1)—(1.3). In order to derive the multi-
symplectic formulation of the Serre equations, we started form the relaxed variational
principle (generalised Hamilton principle) [10]. The derivation is then quite transparent,
as shown in the appendix.

Serre’s equations can be extended in 3D in several ways. One extension of special interest
is the so-called irrotational Green—Naghdi equations [10, 17] for which a multi-symplectic
structure can be easily obtained following the same route as for the Serre equations, i.e.,
starting from the relaxed variational principle.

Our study opens some new perspectives to construct structure-preserving integrators for
the Serre equations. To our knowledge this research direction is essentially open nowadays.
