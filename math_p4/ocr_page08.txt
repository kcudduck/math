Multi-Symplectic Structure for SGN equations 7/9
There are some attempts to solve these equations with conventional finite volume |[8],
pseudo-spectral [13] and finite element [22] methods. However, all these attempts do not
guarantee the preservation of the variational (symplectic or multi-symplectic) structures
at the discrete level as well. Using the findings reported in this manuscript, one should be
able to construct relatively easily finite difference [1, 6, 23, 28] and pseudo-spectral [9, 14]
schemes, which preserve ezactly the multi-symplectic conservation law on the discrete level.
A numerical comparison of symplectic, multi-symplectic and pseudo-spectral schemes was
performed in [12] on the example of the celebrated Korteweg—deVries equation.
A. The workflow pattern
Our study would not be complete if we did not explain how we arrived to the multi-
symplectic structure (2.1) of the Serre equations. It is not so trivial to see how this
structure appears from equations (1.1), (1.2). However, when we derive the Serre system
from the relaxed variational principle [10], a more suitable form of the equations appears.
Namely, the relaxed Lagrangian [10] under the shallow water ansatz reads (see also [13])
&L = (m+ph)¢ - Sgh* + h[pa - 3@ + oo - L% + $f. ], (A1)
where [, U are the Lagrange multipliers. An additional constraint of the free surface
impermeability is imposed:
U= hy + fihg. (A.2)
The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are
ou: 0=p - a (A3)
0v: 0 = hy + phy — 7, (A4)
Sp: 0 =1u+ 3vh, - ¢, (A5)
§¢: 0 =h + [RE],, (A.6)
Sh: 0= jpu- 38° - 30° - fig, — ¢ - gh
- $h[O + i, + Vfig ). (A7)
After eliminating j from equations (A.4)—(A.7) thanks to (A.3) and introducing the extra
variables p = hv, ¢ = hu, r = huv and s = h,, one almost obtains the required system
(2.5)—(2.12) for the multi-symplectic formulation.
