                                                In 1834 John Scott Russell, a Scottish naval engineer, was observing the Union Canal in Scotland
                                          when he unexpectedly witnessed a very special physical phenomenon which he called a wave of translation
                                          [54]. He saw a particular wave traveling through this channel without losing its shape or velocity, and was
                                          so captivated by this event that he focused his attention on these waves for several years, not only built
                                          water wave tanks at his home conducting practical and theoretical research into these types of waves, but
                                          also challenged the mathematical community to prove theoretically the existence of his solitary waves and
                                          to give an a priori demonstration a posteriori.
                                                A number of researchers took up Russell‚Äôs challenge. Boussinesq was the first to explain the existence
                                          of Scott Russell‚Äôs solitary wave mathematically. He employed a variety of asymptotically equivalent equa-
                                          tions to describe water waves in the small-amplitude, long-wave regime. In fact, several works presented
                                          to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1871 and 1872, Boussinesq addressed the problem of the persistence
                                          of solitary waves of permanent form on a fluid interface [12, 13, 14, 15]. It is important to mention that in
                                          1876, the English physicist Lord Rayleigh obtained a different result [50].
                                                After Boussinesq theory, the Dutch mathematicians D. J. Korteweg and his student G. de Vries de-
                                          rived a nonlinear partial differential equation in 1895 that possesses a solution describing the phenomenon
                                          discovered by Russell,

      This note is concerned with the main results already obtained for the initial-boundary value problem
(IBVP) of the KdV equation posed on a finite interval (0, L). The first paper which treated this problem was
given by Bubnov in 1979 [16] when he considered the IBVP of the KdV equation on the finite interval (0, 1)
with general boundary conditions. After that, many authors worked on improving the existing results and
presenting new results in the last 30 years.
